## Description

Letterboxd is a popular film cataloging site, Letterboxd has created a community primarily centered around user opinions. On Letterboxd, users have the ability to “like” any number of reviews. The top three “liked” reviews for each movie appear prominently at the top of that film’s homepage. Additionally, the most popular reviews are often featured on the front page of Letterboxd, further bolstering their visibility.

Given the importance of reviews on Letterboxd, we aim to identify what factors determine a review’s popularity. And given these factors we will construct a model which can predict the popularity (likes) a review would receive.

Due to our teams interest in the topic, we have tackled Letterboxd having a private API through the additional task of scraping our data from [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) for analysis and model conception, as Sarina Singh has devised [scripts](https://github.com/MQCOMP2200-S2-2020/group-project-group100/tree/master/scripts) which scrape Letterboxd using a combination of AutoScraper, Scrapy and Selenium and populate our compiledData.csv.
