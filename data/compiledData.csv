It is a well developed stop motion Christmas special. With Fred Astaire’s narration of the story and the acting likes of Mickey Rooney, Keenan Wynn, and Paul Frees we get a nice selection of characters from their voice acting. As good as the film was I was a bit disappointed at some of the musical aspects of the film. They just didn’t seem strong or compelling as other stop motion films. Robbie Lester has a nice musical moment but isn’t given enough time to make her voice shine during her moment. Overall a never ending enjoyable Christmas film for the family on the holidays.

Literally. I’m not messing with you. I watched this on repeat growing up and it is in my marrow- “when you sit on my lap today/a kiss per toy is the price you pay” let’s think about this - The kringles being good at making toys but just tossing them out because of the winter warlock is a perfect extended metaphor for me being a good writer but throwing out my shit because of insecurity and doubt!!!- also I sing the “put one foot in front of the other” when I’m depressed and trying to get myself to do small tasks- wow is this movie my antidepressants - I hate this movie for being so damn pretty. I’m such a fan of stop motion. And for making me think gingers are hot.- the burgermeister is T R U M P (don’t cha love this hot take)- this penguin should not be in Germany - Mickey Rooney has my heart even though he was a dick to Judy Garland and yes I know he’s dead - I love this Santa origin story and find it hilarious that it somehow still has God in it??,2,2,1,105,198,"14 Dec, 2018"

Okay never expected that when I saw the credits come up.  Second off this is a super clever film that is really weird to watch during this pandemic. A lot of the things they place in here are awesome and I loved seeing the cleverness of it all alongside the fun characters.  Third Gross at times with certain things Murray eats or does.. and it’s still really gross it use to not bug me that much but does more now... that’s where this film falls for me. The human element is beyond cheesy and just cringe at moments.  Animation at times is really good at others weak.  Still I really enjoy this film and would love a remake or another story with these two.

Because doing so has made me realize this movie isn't good, but good and bad. Specifically animated segments good, live-action segments bad. The animated scenes feature rich fluid animation, solid action, and some pretty smart comedy concerning the human body, along with Chris Rock, Laurence Fishburne, and David Hyde Pierce giving pretty good performances. Unfortunately the live-action scenes feature so-so acting, tedious dialogue, and are utterly mundane. These segments could have been salvaged by Bill Murray, but instead of slipping into his ""Great Comedic Actor"" or ""Great Dramatic Actor"" persona he slipped his ""I Don't Give a Flying F@#%"" persona.

Let me tell you something about Ebola, baby. Ebola is a case of DANDRUFF compared to me!” Osmosis Jones is the definition of a middle of the road film. On one hand, it is bursting with creativity in its ideas, world building and animation. On the other hand, it also suffers from the overuse of gross-out humor, generic characters and a lack of energy during the live-action segments. Overall, I would say there is enough here to make it worth watching at least once if you are interested in the concept. The story has plenty of great concepts. It is kind of like a gross version of Inside Out where germs, blood-cells and viruses control the body of Frank DeTorre. This movie has some amazing world building with its creatures and how Frank’s condition affects them. There is something cool in this world every five seconds. The actions of the characters inside Frank translate pretty well to how they affect his wellbeing. Here is the problem with the film. The live-action segments are subpar at best. It’s basically Bill Murray performing gross-out gags and being hungry. While there were a couple of gags that did make me laugh, one of which is a surprisingly effective fart joke near the end, it just came off as unpleasant more than anything. I did like his relationship with his daughter. It felt genuine and sweet with his daughter expressing that she loves her dad and wants to spend more time with him. It is easily the best part of the live-action portion. As for the characters, they are not bad, but they are forgettable. Frank is essentially a walking fart joke. There is not much else to say about him. His daughter Shane is sweet and likable. She seems more concerned about her father’s health than the fact that he embarrasses her in front of her friends. It is refreshing to see a strong father-daughter relationship with the daughter wanting to spend time with her father. Ozzy is a pretty egotistical jerk of a protagonist, but at least he becomes a bit nicer by the end. Still, he is incredibly reckless. His sidekick, Drix, is the best character in the animated portions. He is a pretty likable guy who develops a fun relationship with Ozzy after having an argument. Their chemistry is also really good by the end of the film. The mayor is more unlikable than the villain is, but I think he was made to be a hate sink. The love interest, Leah, is just a flat character that only one good moment. I actually liked the villain. He was a little generic, but his design was cool and it was neat seeing a villain just straight up killing other germs. Also, it helps that Laurence Fishburne’s voice acting make him sound very intimidating. Thrax was a good villain who didn’t need a motivation to be evil. He just enjoyed it. The voice acting is terrific. Chris Rock brings so much energy in Ozzy. That man had a blast with his character and it shows. Fishburne as I said earlier is terrific as Thrax. He gave the character an intimidating presence. William Shatner is great as the selfish mayor, Brandy is pretty good as the love interest despite having a rather thankless role, David Hyde Pierce shows the correct emotion for Drix who is not supposed to be as energetic as Ozzy and Ron Howard is in the movie! I lit up when I saw his name in the credits. As for the live-action portions, Bill Murray and Elena Franklin do have good chemistry, but the material Murray works with is not good. Murray’s performance is pretty indifferent to say the least. Franklin however did a pretty good job with her role. The tone of the film is pretty goofy and silly overall, but the villain is surprisingly dark. It also has a message about eating too much food and being more active. It is nice message that is often overlooked, but it could have been communicated better. Where Osmosis Jones shines is in the visual department. The animation looks stunning. Not only is the movement energetic and the action scenes are crisp and breezy, but the film looks creative with its designs. The characters all have unique designs and abilities. None of them look the same. Ozzy has a couple of cool abilities where he can shape shift into other creatures and it looks so good. The backgrounds and city landscapes look impressive and detailed. It’s amazing how a film that is centered around germs inside of the body looks so remarkable. The cinematography for the live-action parts is the opposite. It looks like a sitcom really. All of the effort went into the animated segments and it shows in nearly every aspect. Why not just make the film animated from start to finish? As for the action scenes, they are entertaining to watch and the animation looks so smooth. They even have a couple of inventive moments such as the surfing scene. The musical score is pretty good. It is not super memorable, but it does sound good.  Osmosis Jones is a movie that I respect more than I like. It is a lot like Sky Captain where it is an admirable film, but a lot of the elements do not work as well as they should. However, the brilliant animation makes this one worth at least one look. Although the live-action segments are not very good, they are few in far between and the animated segments are the focus. Not a bad movie, but it definitely had the potential to be better.",4,20,0,587,524,"17 Jun, 2020"

Viggo Mortensen was very interesting in the role, but he is close to a decade older than the character and it shows some. The gap between him and Kirsten Dunst is okay, though, as it seems baked into the role and the tension of the story. Hyunsook pointed out that Dunst looked a lot like Lee Remick, which I could see and may be part of me not bothered so much by her in this role. I am very curious about the ages in the novel because the ostensible age of Mortensen's character makes him a little young for the relationship with Oscar Isaac, though Mortensen himself is the right age for it to fit. While I expect some tension to build through a Highsmith story, this dragged a little in parts. I would have to say that director Hossein Amini is a much better writer than director. He delivers wonderful scripts, but the pacing seems off here. The movie felt like it was much longer than it actually was. I think he could improve with practice as he got a lot right. I am now very interested in reading the novel.",1,7,0,"1,588",674,"02 Oct, 2019"

Oscar Isaac seems to be on a roll at the moment. He is building up quite a filmography for himself before he goes to a galaxy far far away next year. He had already proven himself to me with his brilliant performance in 'Inside Llewyn Davies' but here he only further cements my high opinion of him. Suave, sophisticated and likeable. He wins you over from the first scene and holds your attention till the last. He and Viggo Mortensen have an electric chemistry on screen together with their scenes at all times keeping you on your toes as to how things are going to play out. Kirsten Dunst plays the women caught in the middle of these two men and she holds her own admirably in the role. it is the strength of the three leads that provides the film with a likeable charm. It glides along effortlessly and was a real pleasure to watch. The visual aesthetic of the film set on the islands on Greece and Crete contains some often beautiful scenery. With a Mediterranean-themed score in the background the whole film feels like a refreshing change of pace. It feels light and accessible while being both smart and entertaining. The story (from 'Drive' writer Hossein Amini) is always compelling with the actors fully utilising the strong script they have been given to work with. Amini also does very well here in his directorial début. He displays a flair behind the camera to match his script. He is definitely one I will be keeping an eye on in the future. The real eye catching part of this film however is the dynamic between Isaac and Mortensen, Their rivalry over the course of the film is utterly gripping with twists and turns in the plot keeping you guessing right up until the satisfying finale. It might not be as high profile as many of the other current releases but this film definitely deserves your time and attention.",2,14,0,264,409,"20 May, 2014"

The glamorous and charismatic American millionaire Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) is in Athens with his young and beautiful wife Colette (Kristen Dunst) for a luxury holiday. They met the also American tourist guide Rydal (Oscar Isaac) who quickly becomes fascinated with the beauty of Colette. Impressed with their extravagant life, Rydal, accepts an invitation to dinner and the couple quickly realize that both men have very similar convictions in life. Both ambitious, greedy and hide secrets. The Two Faces of January is a very well constructed thriller, which despite being fairly simple in terms of history, can be very intelligent. We managed to find similarities with the films of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock and even can say that this can perfectly be a tribute to his brilliant work. The fact that it is so ""Hitchcockian"" certainly gives it a special glow. Suspense, intrigue, lies, and dangerous revelations with an atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia, always work well with the necessary intensity to every moment. The film beautifully portrays the era of the 60's and also has a beautiful cinematography. With regard to interpretation is undoubtedly Viggo Mortensen that stands out most in this film and manages to convince, because he demonstrate a deep, calm, very subtle and refined man, but also shows a feeling of anger and frustration when necessary. The beautiful Kristen Dunst and Oscar Isaac also talented, both have great performances, gradually exploring the virtues and flaws of their characters with small and interesting details that show what each one is, and when I say that, the same applies to the performance of Viggo Mortensen, which is very well supported by these two. A great thriller about two men who destiny crossed, they quickly discover they have more in common than what they expected. Two complete strangers who realize they want exactly the same in life. A coincidence of fate that function as a reflection of the future.",5,25,0,"1,371","2,029","20 Oct, 2014"

Oscar Isaac stared in two such films last year.  A MOST VIOLENT YEAR was a wonderful gangster-esque thriller that was poised for an awards run, but then dumped and discarded by its production company.  THE TWO FACES OF JANUARY was the other ignored film.  I’m not even sure if this got a theatrical run. It is a shame that this film never really had a chance to see the light of day.  I mean, it is not redefining cinema, but it is a solid entry into the man-with-a-mysterious-past / international thriller genre.  The plot revolves around a young American working as a tour guide in Greece.  He is a small time schemer who robs tourists of their pocket money by short changing them.  He gets involved with an American couple that are vacationing across Europe.  They are not who they seem to be either, but on a much larger scale.  Throw in a pinch of sexual desire, embezzlement , intrigue, and murder and this becomes a compelling thriller. The plot of this movie really hangs on the “stranger in a strange place” format.  So much of the film relies on the inability of Viggo to communicate with the people around him.  Isaac does speak the language, and this gives him a power over his marks.   The 3 part cast is all strong.  Viggo is closest to his HISTORY OF VIOLENCE character.  He is helpless at times, and ruthless and conniving at others.  Isaac continues to impress.  This is the first “adult” role I have seen Kiersten Dunst in.  By that I mean that she is playing a grown up, of a woman instead of a girl.  She is still just as lovely as ever, even if her character is a bit underwritten. As I was watching this film I was thinking about THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY, and for me that is a good thing.  I think this movie has a similar look and cinematography, the characters are different of course, but they are comparable, and the score played in a the same effective yet not overwhelming way.",5,18,1,"1,047","1,498","17 Feb, 2015"

Oscar Isaac plays Rydal, a tour guide in Greece who takes a wealthy couple under his wing for the duration of their immediate visitation. Viggo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst play Chester and Colette MacFarland, who are a bit naive, but loaded enough to make light of such things. During their tour through Greece's more consumer friendly sights, Rydal begins showing eyes for Colette, giving the viewer evidence of an up coming love triangle. The movie however, not being one to stay so open to prediction, pulls away from this blatant plot once Chester receives a late night knock on his hotel door. At the doorstep is a man claiming to have unfinished business with Chester. It's revealed to the audience that Chester has long since worked as a scheming and scamming fraud artist claiming to help protect people's offshore bank accounts(giving him access to said accounts in the process). This mystery visitor's client is very unhappy with Chester's scam and is held at gunpoint in the hotel suite's bathroom. Quickly wrestling this man to the ground, Chester accidentally kills him by accident. Now a murderer abroad, Chester and Colette must make a clean getaway back to the states if they are to retain their lavish life styles. The problem is, while attempting to hide the body, Chester is witnessed by Rydal, who now becomes involved in the dilemma. A man of quick wits and many years of experienced plotting, Chester makes sure Rydal's knowledge of Europe's laws, geography and underground networks are put to use by way of blackmail. Thus begins an hour of thrilling police evasion, escalating drama between Cotte's faithfulness to her husband, the troubles of obtaining newly falsified identification documents and not being quite able to read Rydal or Chester's true motives throughout the entire fiasco.  The film is well acted by all 3 of its primary cast members. Yes, even Dunst does a good job here. The storyline is very entertaining and the scenes involving close calls with the authorities are well played out. This is one of those few films of this genre that avoid the characters making stupid decisions, helping me enjoy the ride for what it is. This film had little to no exposure to the masses when released this year, so when you see it pop up on Netflix or Red Box, check it out this little period piece.

Had Hossein Amini and his three leads been working between the 40s and 60s, you'd be absolutely right. For The Two Faces of January lives and breathes the atmosphere of a perfectly passable Sunday afternoon film on BBC2. Had it only been filmed in black and white too. However, that would be a bad thing. Two Faces works best when being a tourism video for the luscious landscapes of Greece and the surrounding area, and it's just the ticket for Hossein Amini's relaxed style. A thriller that never really sets out to thrill, it's a slow-burner of the highest order, and a relic from a time gone by. They don't make 'em like this any more. The source novel is a thing of the same ilk, written by Patricia Highsmith in 1964. Drifting from obstacle to obstacle at a neat little pace, it's quite content trotting along on its own terms. The set-up is simple: glamorous American couple in a foreign land go on the run after the death of a PI who confronts them, assisted by a friendly hustler. Events never particularly get convoluted either, sailing predictably along to a conclusion that satisfies as much as it bores. The film never borders on 'meh', but draws close to 'passable' on many an occasion. That being said, the three central performances are all very solid. Viggo Mortensen isn't without his flaws, particularly in one terrible display of outpouring emotion, but he's ever-compelling as the morally ambiguous and oblivious con artist on the run. Oscar Isaac fares better in a similarly shady role, yet the two leading men eclipse a perfectly decent turn from Kirsten Dunst. I would say it's a shame, but the scenes in which the two men butt heads are among the best in the entire film. Amini's debut is confident in its complacency, only really showing off cinematically in one low-key exit from a crowded public place. The single take used here is as effective as the film gets, yet that's no bad thing; for a youngling director who prefers doing a catwalk to flexing his muscles, it's all absolutely fine.

The film's premise regarding three individuals, a con artist and his wife aided by a local tour guide, on the run from the police due to the death of a private investigator. The film keeps its storytelling on point, with only a few scenes utilised to build its characters and the driving complication; though brief, I never felt distant towards them, Amini has provided enough for audiences to connect with, and the two male characters are flawed enough in their own way that we do not completely place our sympathies towards a singular person. Amini shifts the film's core complication from the evasion of pursuing authorities to an internal conflict between the two leading males. Amini keeps the stakes fundamental by letting the characters concern be found in money or love, unwilling to provide something more complex for the sake of it; Amini's concern is to sweep the audience off their feet with chilling tension and surprising turns, an escapist adventure that manages to have fun in the process. The performances from its three central cast members were great, even when the characters themselves lack depth and complexity, the actors are still able to keep things engaging and foremost, entertaining, through their charming exchanges and intensities during critical moments of conflict. Viggo Mortensen (Chester MacFarland) initially gives off a humbling and welcoming vibe, a quality that is commonly found in Hitchcock's films, then as the plot changes direction, uncharted layers of his personality begin to become apparent; switching our sympathies with Oscar Isaac's (Rydal) character, which initially seemed like the antagonist of the story, with his opportunistic attitude towards Chester's money and wife, played by Kirsten Dunst. Dunst plays her role well, but the film's lack of insight towards her character, prevents me from completely appreciating her efforts; her character seems to be the object of attraction and significance for both the two leading male characters, and because we are constantly being put in their perspectives, we are restricted only to their perception of her. The Two Faces of January should open doors for Hossein Amini's directorial career, proving that he is more than capable in adapting his own scripts, executing them with such inspiration and entertainment that for studios not to exploit his abilities would be a missed opportunity.",5,15,0,112,"4,434","15 Feb, 2015"

And so it is with The Two Faces of January, which doesn't take long to develop into a cat and mouse thriller after a crime is committed early on in the piece. It blurs the lines so you don't really know who is pulling the strings and it's a credit to the three leads (particularly Oscar Isaac in another stand-out role) who keep this tension going. Of course, the scenery is gorgeous and there is certainly a nod to Anthony Minghella's The Talented Mr Ripley in that respect. And as an advertisement for linen suits, it ticks all the boxes and will have you running to your nearest tailor. The ending though, is not quite so satisfying, and this is possibly because it diverts from the source novel's more ambiguous end. However in the line of Highsmith adaptations, this happily sits in the same league as Plein Soleil.",1,5,3,644,"1,129","28 Jun, 2014"

I remember having it on the list of most anticipated and well the film ended up not getting a release theatrically and it didn't even go through any awards circuit. It was only at the Berlin Film Festival that we finally got some buzz on it and it was mixed. It had been almost two years since i first heard of it but i was still intrigued to see what such talented cast could bring. The Two Faces of January is Directed by Hossein Amini and it stars Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst and Oscar Isaac.""1962. A glamorous American couple, the charismatic Chester MacFarland (Mortensen) and his alluring younger wife Colette (Dunst), arrive in Athens by boat via the Corinth Canal. While sightseeing at the Acropolis they encounter Rydal (Isaac), a young, Greek-speaking American who is working as a tour guide, scamming tourists on the side. Drawn to Colette's beauty and impressed by Chester's wealth and sophistication, Rydal gladly accepts their invitation to dinner. However, all is not as it seems with the MacFarlands and Chester's affable exterior hides darker secrets."" Unfortunately though i can't say that am at all impressed with this picture, the film isn't particularly good or bad, it's just straight up standard. It wasn't exactly worth it to wait all this time to finally see it but i will still say that whilst unimpressive and not that surprising The Two Faces of January still manages to entertain. This was Hossein Amini's first effort as a director. Amini who has been a screenwriter for a long while and even has had success has one since he's been nominated for an Academy Award and wrote such pictures as Drive. Here Amini had the opportunity to showcase his talent as both Director and Screenwriter since it was him who adapted Patricia Highsmith to the screen. The direction and the screenplay are just like the film itself, they are not straight up bad but they don't impress. Amini does a solid job on the directors seat but then again i didn't feel like he's approach gave anything exciting or unique to a flawed screenplay. He was never able to create an uneasiness that i think we were supposed to feel. He's never able to create tension or much empathy to the characters that we follow. Though i was never bored and i was still still kept at least hooked, i was never excited about what was going on. The characters never really come to life. I didn't care much for them and i didn't feel chocking stress that these characters feel. Those emotions were never passed from the characters to me, i overall felt pretty distant from the film emotionally. The screenplay is intelligent and i believe that the source material is good. It makes sure that we never know what's going to happen next which made the ending all the more irritating. I felt like the film was taking the easy way out and it ended with a conventional touch that ultimately makes this film be completely forgettable The acting is fine. Viggo Mortensen does a good job though he's also not at the top of his game here, he's just fine. Oscar Isaac is a rising star i hope, after last years Llewyn Davis Isaac appears with a weaker role of course but he's okay and keeps us minimally captivated to the screen. Kristen Dunst is stunning, i always had a crush on her, she's been around for so long that's hard to believe that she's still only 32 years old. Beautiful. charming i was no doubt drawn to the screen when she was in it. The Two Faces of January isn't exactly impressive, don't expect awards or anything riveting out of this piece. It's a solid little film, with some attractive performances and good entertainment value. But the truth is that it never takes risks, it ends up with the wrong foot and overall it felt incredibly unmemorable. Still i would say see it. Rating:C+",11,5,0,438,964,"30 Aug, 2014"

Beautifully shot but frequently languorous in pace, it is the two central performances from Mortensen and Isaac as gentlemen on the cusp of psychosis that captures the imagination and galvanises the cinematic experience of The Two Faces of January. As Chester, Mortensen poses a deconstruction of the toxicity inherent in the archaic conception of the All-American patriarch, whilst Isaac’s Rydal exposes cultural stigmata towards the unpinnable ‘other’, drawing on both the power of foreignness as a persuasive tool but also as a veil under which dark deeds done darkly can be hidden. Kirsten Dunst loses her license a little between the two leading men, but within that present absence there is something to be said for the themes of the male gaze and bodily ownership that run subtextually throughout the course of the film. Overall however, this adaptation is a taut affair at the crucial moments, and sumptuous visually even when the pacing slackens and the dialogue falters. Amini is certainly no Hitchcock, but there are enough shades of the Master of Suspense there to keep the spirit of the psychological thriller genre alive and kicking here.",4,5,0,377,621,"30 Apr, 2019"

The glamorous and charismatic American millionaire Chester MacFarland (Viggo Mortensen) is in Athens with his young and beautiful wife Colette (Kristen Dunst) for a luxury holiday. They met the also American tourist guide Rydal (Oscar Isaac) who quickly becomes fascinated with the beauty of Colette. Impressed with their extravagant life, Rydal, accepts an invitation to dinner and the couple quickly realize that both men have very similar convictions in life. Both ambitious, greedy and hide secrets. The Two Faces of January is a very well constructed thriller, which despite being fairly simple in terms of history, can be very intelligent. We managed to find similarities with the films of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock and even can say that this can perfectly be a tribute to his brilliant work. The fact that it is so ""Hitchcockian"" certainly gives it a special glow. Suspense, intrigue, lies, and dangerous revelations with an atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia, always work well with the necessary intensity to every moment. The film beautifully portrays the era of the 60's and also has a beautiful cinematography. With regard to interpretation is undoubtedly Viggo Mortensen that stands out most in this film and manages to convince, because he demonstrate a deep, calm, very subtle and refined man, but also shows a feeling of anger and frustration when necessary. The beautiful Kristen Dunst and Oscar Isaac also talented, both have great performances, gradually exploring the virtues and flaws of their characters with small and interesting details that show what each one is, and when I say that, the same applies to the performance of Viggo Mortensen, which is very well supported by these two. A great thriller about two men who destiny crossed, they quickly discover they have more in common than what they expected. Two complete strangers who realize they want exactly the same in life. A coincidence of fate that function as a reflection of the future.",5,25,0,"1,371","2,029","20 Oct, 2014"

Firstly, no idea why this isn’t rated higher. Viggo Mortensen is stellar as always, but so is Kristen Dunst & Oscar Issac in this 1960s period peice. Viggo gives a subtle yet tense and believeable performance. The 1960s vibes were strong, from the scenery & setting to the costumes & the colour grading. The setting & locations were extremely beautiful, with the director & DOP being able to capture the beauty of them quite well. The intense, yet mysterious atmosphere reminded me of some classic noir movies, & this was definitely enhanced with the costumes, score, location & setting. It also gave me ‘The Talented Mr. Ripley’ (1999) vibes. I truly enjoyed this film & would definitely recommend it for any old-school noir & crime film lovers or any fans of Viggo, Kristen & Oscar.

Sprawling vistas amongst Athenian temples, bus-treks to Chania, hell, even Ouzo, salad and dancing in cosy villages is the shit I experience every year. And it's down pat to the spot-on tee. There's even the most infinitesimal details in each side-character's mannerisms, personality and dialogue. It's truly impressive and Amini has evoked Greece in the 60's so well.  As a story, though, The Talented Mr. Ripley did a similar tale of triptych criminality (with far more intrigue, far more suspense and far more twisty turns) that this one could never realize. The performances are uniformly strong; with Mortensen doing his exasperated thing, Dunst finding difficulty being on the lam, and Isaac, proving once again why he's amazing and easily mastering the Greek language barrier.  Still, the deceit, lust and fleshing of relationships barely rose above ground. Great on-foot chase in Istanbul and a chilling Hermann-esque score, we'll give it that.",3,5,0,30,686,"21 Jun, 2014"

The story taps into that classic suspense thriller where you are not really sure what's going to happen but inevitability brings you to conclusion. Hossein Amini’s directorial debut looks great within its time and setting. This is the main draw to this film, it's cinematography, setting and palette are rich and impressive. On research I notice Amini wrote the screenplay for Nicolas Winding Refn's amazing film Drive so I expected greatness, unfortunately the screenplay here wasn't delivered with the style, panache and skill as Refn's film. With its subtle music choices and beautiful backdrops domineering and the thriller almost taking second stage I didn't really feel properly engaged in the suspense and drama of the situations they found themselves in and felt like a passenger and rarely involved.

I remember having it on the list of most anticipated and well the film ended up not getting a release theatrically and it didn't even go through any awards circuit. It was only at the Berlin Film Festival that we finally got some buzz on it and it was mixed. It had been almost two years since i first heard of it but i was still intrigued to see what such talented cast could bring. The Two Faces of January is Directed by Hossein Amini and it stars Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst and Oscar Isaac.""1962. A glamorous American couple, the charismatic Chester MacFarland (Mortensen) and his alluring younger wife Colette (Dunst), arrive in Athens by boat via the Corinth Canal. While sightseeing at the Acropolis they encounter Rydal (Isaac), a young, Greek-speaking American who is working as a tour guide, scamming tourists on the side. Drawn to Colette's beauty and impressed by Chester's wealth and sophistication, Rydal gladly accepts their invitation to dinner. However, all is not as it seems with the MacFarlands and Chester's affable exterior hides darker secrets."" Unfortunately though i can't say that am at all impressed with this picture, the film isn't particularly good or bad, it's just straight up standard. It wasn't exactly worth it to wait all this time to finally see it but i will still say that whilst unimpressive and not that surprising The Two Faces of January still manages to entertain. This was Hossein Amini's first effort as a director. Amini who has been a screenwriter for a long while and even has had success has one since he's been nominated for an Academy Award and wrote such pictures as Drive. Here Amini had the opportunity to showcase his talent as both Director and Screenwriter since it was him who adapted Patricia Highsmith to the screen. The direction and the screenplay are just like the film itself, they are not straight up bad but they don't impress. Amini does a solid job on the directors seat but then again i didn't feel like he's approach gave anything exciting or unique to a flawed screenplay.

With Hitchcock and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" as primary influences (it's based on a Patricia Highsmith novel), it eschews modern expectation of mystery films to pack twists around every corner and instead relies on: - suspenseful, alluring yet straightforward storytelling (what does a freelance tour guide want with a visiting American couple?) - compelling characters (there's only 3, and each gets to harbor some mystique while getting the full developmental treatment, and carefully inhabited by an excellent trio of actors) - an evocative setting (1960s Greece, in the ruins of the Acropolis of Athens) That's it!

""I wouldn't trust him to mow my lawn."" Like a good, fun, pure rom-com, it's becoming increasingly difficult to find an excellent thriller. No, I don't mean a schlocky action fest where cars turn over, buildings explode and Harrison Ford wields a gun, but a clever caper that uses words and the mind to excite.  Enter The Two Faces of January, which has a cool vintage aesthetic that recalls the awesome The Debt back on 2011 (a film I adore). Except, unlike John Madden's spy tale, January is a consistently excellent, evenly paced work. New multi-hyphenate Hossein Amini is best known for the cool, muted script behind Drive, another 2011 film. While it racks up a larger word count than his previous work, the same sensibilities remain. Although Drive is incredibly violent, it still utilised the mind of the viewer to excite, adding to the action that was happening. This is ever-present in January, where no shooting or car chases take place, but instead tension-building moments of a cross country journey that has many close shaves. Amini once again relies heavily on the expressions actors can convey, carrying out entire conversations and set-ups through glances, injecting silence into moments of great tension, never being afraid to pause.  This stylish approach spills over into the direction, which has a distinctive, sleek aesthetic. The most interesting element, however, is the use of setting. Many of the locations are those that would commonly be shown in sweeping wide-angles, looking as though they are pulled straight from a postcard, destined for a tourism reel. While their beauty and significance is talked about by the characters, they are commonly shown as dusty, deserted, and not inviting, and, beyond the first act of the film, many scenes aren't even set in iconic landmarks. By opting for backstreets, sleeping on benches and run down cafes and apartments over shiny, opulent rooms, Amini creates a cool, metallic, knife-edge vibe, to the extent that, even though much of the film is set in warm sun, one feels a biting chill, foreboding and unappealing.  Playing three characters that all (of course) have something to hide, performers Isaac, Mortensen and Dunst are all excellent. In terms of role, Dunst's character of Colette is the classic damsel, given the least to work with, but elevates her performance past what could have been purely a pawn in her male costars actions. As the eerie Chester, Mortensen is cold and sinister, hinting at further backstories for the audience to consider. This is also evident in yet another great performance from Isaac, who continues being a jack-of-all-trades in terms of playing different ethnicities (Russian, Greek, Latin American...), but instead is given the reverse of Mortensen, playing the classic good guy with a dark side. Overall, The Two Faces of January is an intelligent, brilliant thriller. It's the kind of film I adore, where you're left excited by what may happen next and refreshed by how sublimely simple it is compared to many films which grace wide release today.

Kind of a problem when the film's about a young swindle artist with daddy issues getting caught up in an older man's schemes. The direction is helped greatly by Mortensen and Oscar Isaac, who find the meat in a bare-bones script, and by the on-location scenery of Turkey and Greece.  This is good, because Hossein Amini never whips this Patricia Highsmith-penned thriller up to nearly the heights of tension or emotion it deserves. There is some good visual styling going on — bright imagery and slick outfits in a restrained color palette — check the scene where Mortensen's character attempts to demonstrate to his wife (Kirsten Dunst) that the Acropolis is built on an uneven foundation, shot from an angle where we can't verify the fact of the architecture but clearly see the imbalance of power between them. It's a tantalizing lead-in to a main story that never quite delivers on its promise.

As shifty tour guides somehow manage to do, Rydal ingratiates himself on the well-to-do couple. Chester and Collette MacFarland (Vigo Mortensen and Kirsten Dunst) end up taking a liking to Rydal. It is not long before a tour around the flea market turns into a dinner invitation, and dinner turns into setting the couple up with fake passports and escorting them out of the city after an ""incident"" at their hotel. Shifty isn't in short supply in Athens, it seems. Though The Two Faces of January is his first time in the director's chair, with screenplays that stretch back to Michael Winterbottom's Jude, Hossein Amini is no stranger to the film making world or for that matter to critical acclaim. Here he works off source material from 'The Talented Mr Ripley' author, Patricia Highsmith, and the results are serviceable, if resolutely unremarkable. Watchable, would appear to be the best descriptor. The film has the locales, the cast and the look, but Amini struggles to give the situation a discernible pulse. Isaac and Dunst don't connect like they need to, nor is Mortensen asked to bring out any of his abundant menace. It is reasonably clear that all three have been directed to aim for understated, slow burn drama but they're working with a less than supportive script and so the results are just plain slow. Slow and dispassionate. As a screenwriter from way back Amini should have been able to come up with more than this. For a psychological thriller The Two Faces of January is light on thrills and even lighter on psychology. It holds attention but only barely. If you are keen to watch, maybe pick you're timing to maximise enjoyment. I'd suggest you save till you are next holidaying... on Crete... and it's raining out...",4,7,0,794,"1,305","29 Jun, 2014"

It's not a great film but it sure did pass the time (if nota little long). Jason Bateman is always likeable; Ryan Reynolds is as well, to a certain extent; and then Olivia Wilde, Alan Arkin and President Charles Logan are always a pleasure to watch, especially Wilde. I love these body switch movies and when you have a great cast you can't really go wrong with them. This movie is funny (okay, some jokes fall flat) and it's touching (and a little cheesy) in all the right ways. It's slickly shot and it goes for a hard R (I watched the unrated version) so it's got hard comedy, sex and nudity. It's also a movie you can't think about to much after, or while watching, or you will ask yourself things like how did he learn to be a lawyer in, like, a day? Or all this happened in a week? Or what's with those weird looking boobs? Those weird looking boobs are part of the bad CGI that is prevalent throughout this movie. There are some terrible looking baby effects and some terrible looking boobs. I don't get this fake boob thing. I get it if an actress doesn't want to get naked but from what I hear Olivia Wilde worse tassels on her nipples and then nipples were CGI'd in. Really? Did tassels and a thong really make you feel like you weren't naked? Especially since you don't seem to mind doing nude scenes? So if this film was cut down by about 15 minutes, had a stronger script, had better effects and had real boobs (okay, I'll take fake ones if that is all I can get) it would be a hell of a lot better but even still Bateman and Reynolds and a great supporting cast make this watchable, enjoyable and worth seeing. That and the Lorno scenes.

The overall plot of the film is still basic even with its unique premise on an overused genre, and the acting is really great. It feels like both actors really are playing each other and they make the same faces and expressions that the others would make which I thought was impressive. Most of the comedy is raunchy but funny, and overall it was just a basic but funny subpar movie. I would recommend to anyone who is fine with a harder r rating than other comedies.",1,2,0,33,32,"27 Aug, 2020"

It's a very unfunny comedy that despite being rated 15 (English rating) it's more aimed at twelve year olds who haven't quite developed a sense of humor yet. Honestly I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but it really is a load of rubbish. I think the obviously implausible story is the worst thing about it, as it's already been done before and it wasn't even good then. The film stars the sometimes funny Jason Bateman and the ever annoying Ryan Reynolds whose very low brow comedy just does nothing for me.

Nope, you don't. Neither did I. Unless you really, really love ""Vice Versa"", and no one really loves ""Vice Versa"", you haven't given body switching movies a second thought since at least ""Face/Off"" (yeah, I would never have thought to mention ""Vice Versa"" and ""Face/Off"" in the same paragraph either, but here I am). ""The Change-Up"" might very well be the best body-switching comedy ever made. Not that this means you should care about it. I certainly didn't. But then I learned a fact about this film that changed everything, and I had to watch it immediately: this movie contains nude footage of Leslie Mann*. I've always thought she was cute, but I never had a burning desire to see what was happening beneath her clothes. But my source told me that she was hiding some real treasures, and Best Buy had the blu-ray on sale for five dollars, so I am now the proud owner of ""The Change-Up"". And you know what? I have no regrets.  Movies that try to balance raunchy and heartwarming are difficult to pull off. David Dobkin, the director of ""The Change-Up"" tried this balance in ""The Wedding Crashers"" to, I thought, little success. The raunchy moments of ""Wedding Crashers"" struck me as hilarious (such as any scene involving Vince Vaughn and Isla Fisher) while the allegedly heartwarming elements (any scene involving Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams) fell flat for me. ""The Change-Up"" works much better because the heartwarming stuff sneaks its way into the raunch, rather than being completely separated from it. Also, ""The Change-Up"" remains defiantly dedicated to nudity and raunch and edgy jokes for its entire length rather than coming to a screeching halt for moments of unearned sentiment. ""The Change-Up"" also earns those moments of sentiment with two hilarious performances from Jason Bateman and Deadpool himself, Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds is just as vulgar and rat-a-tat-tat here as he was in ""Deadpool"", and Bateman brings his usual sardonic straight man routine to the table. Neither of these actors is doing anything new here, but thankfully they don't have to. They don't play one another as well as Travolta and, especially, Nic Cage did in ""Face/Off"" or even as well as Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan did in ""Freaky Friday"", but they work well enough and make this a very fun ride. It's consistently hilarious, has a few things to say about domesticity and family without battering the audience over the head with them, and manages to delve deeper than I expected. Granted, I didn't expect any depth here at all, so anything is a bonus. I popped this in hoping for a good laugh and I got a lot of them, and the sentiment didn't irritate me so that worked as well. Also, this movie has a respectable commitment to nudity which I thoroughly appreciated. Not only is Leslie Mann a very funny actress, but...um...Wow. Judd Apatow is a lucky man.

Then I watch a movie like The Change Up and I start to remember that you don't need a great script at all, you just need the right pals in the right places, because that's the only possible way to explain away this turd of a 'comedy', that David Dobkin--who did give us the decent Wedding Crashers, so he can do better--must have friends upstairs. There is only one reason to watch this movie, and it's not Dobkin and hells teeth is certainly is not the steaming wreck of a script. Nope, that reason is one man: Jason Bateman. He's normally more than decent anyway, despite the fact he can pick crud roles every now and then, but here he gets the opportunity to play against type - he starts off as Dave, a typical Bateman character; middle-aged, harried, unfulfilled, but then he gets to switch gears as the body-swap fantasy concept at the movie's heart kicks in and becomes Mitch, a self-serving arsehole of the highest order, played originally by Ryan Reynolds who... well, as per usual, I struggle to see the point in. Bateman clearly enjoys playing a complete jerk and he's surprisingly good at it, and as stated the single reason The Change Up is worth any of your time... because the rest of it sucks. Truly sucks. It's not funny, it's not dramatic, it's not charming, it's not sweet and it's too long by a good twenty minutes. And to make matters worse it becomes horribly, inevitably sentimental toward the end because, y'know, these guys may be selfish idiots but we'll love them if they've Learned Their Lesson. Bah. If you're going to make a comedy, do one of either two things: make the characters likeable & charming & no matter what they go through, make us care and root for them; or make it vicious, make a bastard a bastard & let us enjoy their downfall while making us laugh like drains. Don't make The Change Up, which isn't so much bad as it is a complete waste of time - not to mention a waste of some real talent.

They don't play one another as well as Travolta and, especially, Nic Cage did in ""Face/Off"" or even as well as Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan did in ""Freaky Friday"", but they work well enough and make this a very fun ride. It's consistently hilarious, has a few things to say about domesticity and family without battering the audience over the head with them, and manages to delve deeper than I expected. Granted, I didn't expect any depth here at all, so anything is a bonus. I popped this in hoping for a good laugh and I got a lot of them, and the sentiment didn't irritate me so that worked as well. Also, this movie has a respectable commitment to nudity which I thoroughly appreciated. Not only is Leslie Mann a very funny actress, but...um...Wow. Judd Apatow is a lucky man.

Jason Bateman and Ryan Reynolds swap bodies after urinating into an enchanted fountain in what I think is meant to be a deliberate throwback, if had more vulgarity. There is the odd moment of genuine humour, but it's surrounded by projectile poo, CGI nudity, the hilarity of cursing at small children and the fact that Reynolds' character is just hateful and self-centered, frequently confusing being gross for actual laughs. And yet there's a weirdly saccharine streak in there too, which feels both awkward and insincere in contrast to everything else (Alan Arkin appears as Reynolds' father in a subplot that should have been excised entirely). It also long wears at out it's welcome at an indulgent two-hour running time, and sure feels like as it drags towards the finish.

For some, it may appear as a clear assurance that Leigh has gone on some sort of historical route (spoiler, he has probably not!) and many will feel fatigued by what is essentially a 2,5-hour montage of lengthy, political speeches from people you might not even remember by the end of the film. It’s true that Peterloo may be one of Leigh’s least accessible films. He doesn’t single out any clear leads and instead creates a dense cast of many smaller characters who each get their time and space to do their thing. There aren’t any relatable characters in that sense as there’s hardly any time to relate to any specific character. In the case of Peterloo, Leigh doesn’t want to try and make you sympathize with any individuals but instead make you aware of the mistreatment of a larger group of people, indeed, a large part of society. Thematically Leigh hasn’t changed a bit, however. But where his most beloved films showed his feelings for the working class’ through his usual dramatic sensibilities, Peterloo is deliberately made to feel dry and dour. This doesn’t take away Leigh’s knack for character as any and every person on screen looks and talks as if they were transported straight from the 19th century. While they may not undergo the character-development we’re used to seeing in his films, together they do form an important portrait of a part of society that he’s all too familiar with. For the things that keep us up today aren’t very different from what they were back then. Leigh’s humble epic makes a not so subtle comparison to our modern times. The imbalance between the high lords of politics and the common man is shown vividly and a lot of time is spent showing the ways in which both sides prepare for battle. And yes, that battle is made up almost entirely of words. Orations, speeches, rousing the public with your voice! When, at the very end, the infamous massacre does take place, it is shown to be an act of pure cowardice, as those in control are too scared to let their place of power be taken in a righteous way. The Peterloo Massacre is only one of many instances in history showing a class struggle get completely out of hand, merely because people are too scared to share power and control with others. It won’t take long before films like this will be made on “les gilet jaunes”. The fact alone that Leigh felt the need to make this film now, shows that we have still a long way to go. While his film may not have the expected (or necessary) sense of drama to really shake up its viewing audience - even the massacre feels somewhat shallow despite some gruesome shots throughout -, it does tell its story in a rightful manner and in the end that may be the best we could want from a film like this. Nowhere near Leigh’s best but in any case a solid drama, deserving of deeper analysis and appreciation in times to come. Hopefully, the wait for such analyses won’t take too long, as we’ve all waited long enough already.",4,15,0,962,"2,477","07 Mar, 2019"

This is different, a sprawling historical epic with lots of stands and characters, far bigger in scope and budget then we've seen before.  I have the greatest respect for Leigh, but Peterloo isn't my favourite. It has the feel of a work who's content is so important to the film-maker that treating it with respect is more important than making the movie cinematic or entertaining. Or concise. Educational though: very convincing and interesting. And it's a (sadly rare) treat to see working class themes and people involved in a major modern film. This screening was one of the opening films of the Leeds International Film Festival, and was followed by an excellent q&a with the director.

And yet, the film’s politics, while bracing and righteous, have a flattening effect on character that’s cartoonish both when evoking the lambs, like a poor soldier who survives Waterloo only to be cut down at Peterloo, and the elitist monsters who lead them to the slaughter.

Or really, neither of those things per se, but the first act is a slightly confounding swirl of random character moments that don't, in the end, actually end up contributing to the film's portrayal of collectivism vs. bureaucratic greed, and I was very glad when the film finally started to adopt a structure around an hour through.

On a macro scale, the film takes an initial stumble, because of its unfortunately heavy reliance on a more verbal storytelling, rather than a visual one. Its language, although powerful at times, isn’t poetic or built by imagery, but by bread-and-butter issues. There are a vast assortment of speeches, protests, and public gatherings in Peterloo, and none of them really differ in content or makeup. It’s a painstaking approach, but like all masters, Leigh proves there’s a method to the madness. By recounting history from the inside out, he was able to turn his film’s acquired taste into something more universal. Through a basic presentation of real world struggles, Leigh manages to not only connect audience members to the source material, but comment on reoccurring issues that plague our culture’s current status.",1,15,1,105,346,"08 Sep, 2019"

This is a film all about communication, the importance of it, and how it can fail. It’s no surprise then that a lot of the film is centred around meetings, rallies and speeches, and the subtle differences between each one.  This of course is all pretext to a pretty devastating final act that is very uncomfortable viewing.

Oh sad day.   Naturally I align with his politics and endorse the compulsion to exhume those true tales of tyranny which always hold relevance, but this turgid speechy mule cast in the lustrous angularity of a Netflix Original (or any streaming behemoth of yr choice, $4.59 per view) is barely recognizable as a product of the same impeccable doyen I have adulated my whole life, a man who over the last 50 years single-handedly forged his own unique system of social drama.  The argument that 'period' is not his forte is clearly amiss, because Mr Turner, Topsy Turvy and to a lesser degree Vera Drake, all work so beautifully.  Perhaps this is because they maintain focus on two of his primary concerns - the individual and society, and artistic process - while Peterloo is a sprawling, decentralized porridge that can be relegated to the shelf alongside any one of those tepid Beeb 19C adapts. Maybe the only commendable aspect I can think of here is his decision to populate the film with relatively unknown faces, a respectful maneuver which demonstrates an unwillingness to tether such subject matter to an iconography.  That said, it's hard to imagine how his superb regular thesp stalwarts may have made this more durable or more awkward. Of course even our heroes are only human, and in their latter years shall stumble and fall as if returning to infancy.  And Leigh has already contributed so much as to be beyond all scrutiny.

A wordy and length dramatic look at the St Peter's Fields massacre which took place in Manchester in 1819, so this is almost a 200th anniversary commemoration.   Mike Leigh has created a sense of 19th century Lancashire with dark opening scenes, and small exchanges in court, market place, and outside the mills.  Although there are some recognisable names in the cast - Maxine Peake, Philip Jackson, Rory Kinnear, Tim McInnerny (suitably grotesque as the Prince Regent) - Leigh does not 'do' star casting, and the story and improvised script is the real star here. Although the facts are accurate, including the practice drilling in Saddleworth, and the paranoia within the judiciary and Parliament against what they describe as ""political sedition"".  The family we see in Peterloo is fictional, but brings us closer to the human cost of these brave men and women who rose up, peacefully, to ask for parliamentary reform. This is an important film, although not one which achieved award nominations or box office grosses (whether it should is a very different question).  As someone born in Oldham, Peterloo is well-known in the area, despite Manchester now being changed beyond recognition, and I recognise the look of the working class men and women depicted here from photographs from the turn of the 20th century.",5,12,0,556,"2,449","30 Jul, 2019"

It's a tidy summation of the two-pronged aim of at least three quarters of the film - even the most well-intentioned passion coexists with a sense of ego - but it also feels like a dare to the audience. It's not an emotional provocation to see the impending violence like something like Detroit so miserably attempted but rather a resignation that history doesn't happen with the poetry that it's afforded in so many books or paintings. It's not just grisly, but awkward, and prone to the whims of confusion and the idiocy of a few scared men cowering at a windowsill at the scant possibility of change. Leigh makes you feel the length of Peterloo, supplying nearly every character and class of people with their own fiery (and often redundant) rhetoric that moves their individual audience - and crucially, feels totally absent of specifics. They have the passion, but don't begin to have the tools to enact change and so everything is talk. It's conversation that's often boring and tedious and filtered like a game of telephone until an errant spud becomes a lethal missile. And whether it's the Manchester Female Reform (featured in a beautiful scene that shows a nascent but vital movement) or orator Hunt (a real piece of work), they both showcase a type of ineffective politicking that's less advocating for violence than directness. Relatedly, there's no end credit post-script that justifies what happens in the film. The people affected are still years away from any kind of valuable change or the hope of a better life. There's a possibility that the climax of this could have felt redundant, but it doesn't. The escalations feel totally spontaneous in a way that's expansive without being simply about the scope. Instead, it happens in such a way that the only right ending is to return to the humility of the loss of a single life away from the constant speechifying and its mythic historical weight.",4,6,0,228,474,"13 Jul, 2019"

Detailing one of England's most infamous massacres, Peterloo takes its time getting to the climactic carnage (as one would hope and expect), but it's most effective in how it examines both sides of the conflict. The aristocracy and rebellious working class of 19th century England are giving about equal screen-time here, and the extensive dialogue is rich and witty in a way that always keeps Peterloo engaging. Of course, the film's concluding reenactment of an atrocity is highly memorable, staged and edited delicately, and while brutal, it also avoids being overtly gory.

Mike Leigh is angry and even though his anger isn't as cleverly channeled like in his smaller scale films, it is still there in every detail, it bursts under the confusion that is so well conveyed throughout the film. The film moves firmly and strongly, quite solemnly but it never reaches any conclusion nor does it even really feel like going anywhere, rather we are left with the sense of a country in turmoil. Nothing makes things as explosive as the fact that the hope is somewhere to be seen but still nowhere near - the wait, not knowing when makes one powerless. Its declaratory tone is certainly too much for some as it never offers any character development nor sense of movement forwards. The whole film is an attempt to film the unfilmable, a kind of intellectual and emotional stagnation that very clearly reflects the current British society. Characterizations of the authorities are perhaps a tad too rounded and typified but on the other hand it seems to fit the tone of confusion as the authorities are driven to corner to protect their capital by any means necessary. When faced with irrational fear, people turn into caricatures of themselves and when authorities do that (more often than the working class and the poor), it is especially destructive for the people and the nation - as we have witnessed with the rise of likes of Johnson and Trump.",2,5,0,223,"2,062","12 Feb, 2020"

Too much like a dry history lesson, some said. Too much speechifying and needs an hour cut out of it, others said. Too many characters and not enough character development, needs to focus in on one or two stories and follow them through the broader historical sweep so we have someone to identify with, was a common criticism. Seeing it again, I now know why I disagree and what I think Leigh is doing here. The key scene that pulls all this together is the collection of shots that show the crowds flocking into St Peter's Field in Manchester on 16 August 1819, culminating in a series of cavalry and foot attacks on the 100,000-strong crowd that left 18 dead and 700 more wounded. There are some identifiable characters in that crowd for whom we have some back story: orator Henry Hunt (Rory Kinnear) the sole speaker at the rally, Nellie (Maxine Peake) and her son Joseph (David Moorst) who has come back from Waterloo with PTSD, and the small group of local agitators who are organising the rally. However, the scale on which Leigh has chosen to tell the story, and why it has such power, is that this is not a story about individuals (even Hunt is a bit player). The main character is the people of Manchester. Those crowds flooding into the rally, distinguishable as groups by their clothing and/or their banners, are like the strands of a rope which come together and gain their strength from expressing a collective demand for voting reform (at the time less than 3% of the population had the vote and Manchester did not have an MP). There is certainly plenty of speechifying but this serves to lay out the strands in the rope - the meetings in the factories, at the reform associations, the women's groups, even the practices of peaceful drilling and marching on Saddleworth Moor - take on a different weight when they all come together in the same place on the same date. And this is not dry history. The opposition to the social and political movement that eventually did win voting reform 13 years later was partly driven by the desire to maintain their privilege but also a fear that the influence of the French and American Revolutions might inspire British workers to fight for greater control over their own lives. You also do not have to stretch very far to find parallels to today on both sides of the Atlantic. My only reservation about the film is that the ruling class - Home Secretary Lord Sidmouth (Karl Johnson), Prime Minister Lord Liverpool (Robert Wilfort), Prince Regent (Tim McInnerny) and their entourage of local magistrates and mill owners - are portrayed as caricatures and grotesques, appropriate for agitprop but jarring slightly here. I saw this film again in one of the large Nova cinemas and was much more aware of Robert Ireland's superb sound design. There are a couple of scenes early on that involve a tracking shot down a row of mechanical looms in a large factory, ending in a wide shot of maybe 100+ looms weaving at full speed.  The noise is tremendous and the cinema floor was shaking with the vibrations. Leigh cuts to a quiet scene where the silence is a shock, then cuts back to the factory noise again. It reminded me that we still refer to sheets and towels as manchester and that William Blake's ""dark satanic mills"" did not just refer to the steel mills of the Industrial Revolution. I also liked that Leigh concludes with the two journalists walking across the deserted field, still strewn with people's belongings, then the credits roll. Other directors would have had a text roll that explained how this massacre led to positive changes, eventually, in terms of universal suffrage, unionisation, health and safety in workplaces, the role of a free press. Leigh leaves you to chase all that up for yourself if you want to know more; all his threads come together at the rally and end there. P.S.: In checking the timeline of events around the time of Peterloo, I realised that it was only a few years after the Luddite Rebellion began in 1811 and only six years after 14 Luddites were hanged in Manchester after a rushed one-day trial. While Leigh makes no mention of these events, it does throw a sharper focus on his early scenes of exceedingly rough justice being dished out by the local magistrates.",11,5,1,50,274,"12 May, 2019"

All those words and speeches (the stuff that others are complaining about, as if it never occurred to them that the persistent emphasis upon oration as both a symptom and effect of political empowerment isn't an essential part of thematising class war in 1810s England): I loved it. It's intricate, dense, complex: not just in the verbosity of the language used, but in the likely allegiances and objective interests signified by its varied uses. And by the regional accents: consider when Bamford and Healey travel to London and first meet 'fellow reformer' Hunt, who shuns them (Bamford's final remarks on the husting provide a sharp critique of Hunt just before the consequences of his pacifism make themselves disastrously known). Consider, too, the great scene in which Christine Bottomley and Kate Rutter's characters work through fluctuating levels of social confidence in response to the alienating lexis of Mary Fildes (Dorothy Duffy) and Susannah Saxton (Victoria Moseley). Don't tell me these scenes aren't engrossing dramatisations and examinations of micro and bodily dialectics at play.  Even the somewhat pat conversation between outraged journalists arriving at the eponymous neologism and agreeing to detail the massacre in their respective newspapers reinforces the central theme of linguistic dexterity: language as firearm, bushfire, earthquake. Leigh's final eschewal of a text-based coda, denying us any comfortable 'Wiki' distancing from the events depicted, seems somehow only to underline this further.

However his milieu is generally the domestic but here he broadens his canvas to take in the shameful events in St Peter's Fields in Manchester where a peaceful pro-democracy gathering was broken up by soldiers resulting in the death and maiming of hundreds gathered there. Yet while this is a larger story, Leigh keeps his focus on the minutiae, which is often banal, of the planning that went into the big event, on both sides. It's clear where the director's sympathies lie and yet he still paints shades of grey into his characters so that you do get a sense of realism in what was happening two centuries ago.

Aside from scrupulously recreating the material particulars of the Peterloo massacre (an assumption I’m making due to the movie’s emphasis on certain odd characters or side tangents that, if they weren’t part of the empirical evidence, would be dramatically inexplicable), Leigh’s primary project is tracing various levels and forms of rhetoric on both the left and right. On the left, this tends to take the form of disputes about activism and demonstration vs. its efficacy (or lack thereof), with a side concern about when highfalutin’ vocabulary can be too windy to actually drive the point home, thereby losing the audience which should theoretically be galvanized. This is the old “form vs. content” activism debate—is revolutionary form necessary, or a classist impediment that should be discarded for the greater political good? Leigh chooses conventional form, but the period setting gives him license to write lots of florid dialogue, which makes everything more fun while also potentially losing the punters. But, in fact, there will be no proletarian audiences just waiting to be mobilized at Mike Leigh’s 154-minute period movie (sponsored by Amazon), so it’s a false dilemma. This is not a movie for people who need to have their revolutionary consciousness fomented, so it doesn’t worry about it. Leigh is not subtle at connecting the historical dots: Manchester’s relationship to labor history doesn’t require explication, nor does the bit where the yeomen get rowdy on beer before kicking ass, proto-xenophobic soccer hooligans ahead of their time. I think this movie’s primary purpose is to get your dander up and, to the extent that I made some remarkably petty connections between what I saw and work experiences I’ve had over the years, I think it’s successful.",3,15,0,105,"3,901","24 Apr, 2019"

The film goes at great lengths to set the table for the day in question, taking the first two-thirds plus to do so. My main complaint about the film is that there is too much time spent on the lead up to the massacre than there is the aftermath. There is also a lot of repetition in the speeches the characters give throughout the film, with many orators vying for their time in the spotlight. It's like an orator-a-thon - a speech is given every 5 minutes in this film, it's crazy. That being said Leigh's script is interesting enough to have kept me engaged throughout, and the massacre itself is directed with great care and is truly incredible to behold.

Mike Leigh's Peterloo is a film of the working class, of the fight for liberty and against oppression. It's also about the inevitable, bloody backlash from those with power. Peterloo is a very specific story, of an event sadly not widely known, and Leigh creates a film showcasing context and detail that is sure to be illuminating for most. The film captures a lost time, and I love the way Leigh makes history breathe with regional accents and a lived-in world. Peterloo is a film mostly of rhetoric and speeches, crafting a history of words that slowly becomes one of action. The chaotic titular massacre is a horrifying sequence, a sequence of senseless violence that feels both too long and too short. Mike Leigh is great at spotting people in a crowd, and Peterloo manages to find the individuals who make up a collective. The shots often linger, and often on one person, sometimes on one person surrounded by many others. This is slow and contemplative cinema, capturing history without compromising its authentic, emotional pull. This is an ensemble piece, and I recognised so many actors from minor roles on British television. This is Peterloo's strength, showing us a mass of people, a group with a purpose, and making them feel real and distinct. We feel like we're part of the crowd. Peterloo is a history lesson, a mesmerising look at a point in time. With plenty of detail and well-examined characters, Peterloo is a film worth checking out for historical interest as well as for great cinema. Side-note: It's great to see a major event from the history of the North of England finally shown onscreen and with authentic accents and dialogue. I'm sure that endeared my audience towards it, even if it's from the wrong side of the country (ugh, Lancashire).  After the film, Mike Leigh was there and did a Q&A with the audience. Some interesting things discussed: - When asked about his current trend of making historical films, Leigh rejected the idea that he was in a trend and said he just makes the films he wants to and that his next project may not be historical. - Leigh said that he has no interest in making television and that cinema is his preferred artform. - Leigh said there's no onscreen text at the end of Peterloo explaining later events because he didn't want to patronise the audience. Similarly, he also didn't want to make parallels to contemporary events because he wants the audience to think for themselves. - Leigh was open about the fact that the film is dramatised, but a lot of what he said makes it seem like he tried very hard to be accurate. Apparently some of the dialogue is taken verbatim from historical records. - Leigh claimed that all the actors playing northern characters were northern and not southerners putting on an accent. 2018 Ranked",11,52,13,740,"7,780","01 Nov, 2018"

Político por vários motivos: porque é um filme que já está há tempos vagando pela internet e seria mais cômodo vê-lo em casa; porque é dirigido por um cineasta de que eu gosto muito e de que vi os últimos nove filmes, este incluso, no cinema, então, foi um jeito de me manter fiel às experiências que ele me traz há mais de 20 anos; e por uma razão mais literal: trata-se de um filme, literalmente, político.  Para minha absoluta surpresa, minha decisão de assistir ao filme numa sala de cinema se tornou um experimento mais particular ainda. Eu era o único espectador da sala 3 do Espaço Itaú da Augusta, que tem 171 lugares. E isso aconteceu no dia de estreia do filme, numa sessão às 21h, numa das regiões mais movimentadas do Brasil. Nem as distintas senhoras dos Jardins estavam lá. Nem os ""eurófilos"" de Higienópolis compareceram.  Fiquei tentando imaginar o que poderia ter causado este fenômeno porque, digo sem pestanejar: nunca, em toda minha vida cinéfila, nos meus 20 anos frequentando os cinemas da região da Paulista, eu vi uma sessão absolutamente sozinho nestes cinemas. Sempre tinha pelo menos mais um gato pingado. Ainda mais em se tratando de um cineasta conhecido do público que frequenta o circuito de filmes de autor na cidade (que não é pequeno). Mike Leigh fez ""Segredos e Mentiras"", mas também fez ""O Segredo de Vera Drake"", ""Agora ou Nunca"", ""Topsy-Turvy"", ""Simplesmente Feliz"", que sempre tiveram a atenção de um público cativo.  Mas hoje era só eu. E talvez tenha sido por causa do calor, da facilidade de encontrar o filme na internet, da demora da distribuidora em decidir lançá-lo no cinema, da repercussão um tanto limitada que ele teve em festivais e com a crítica. Muitas possibilidades. Mas uma delas me parece ser uma aposta mais certa: talvez este ""tipo de filme"" tenha perdido seu público. De uma maneira geral e, principalmente, no Brasil. ""Peterloo"", como eu disse antes, é um filme literalmente político. Não que Mike Leigh esteja estreando no engajamento social. Pelo contrário. Praticamente todos os filmes citados - e os outros não citados - mesmo que sejam comédias aparentemente leves ou dramas humanistas, são observações agudas sobre a vida e as condições de vida da classe trabalhadora britânica. Leigh talvez seja o cineasta que mais se dedicou a entender quem é, de onde veio e que lugar no mundo esse inglês ""da base"" conseguiu. ""Peterloo"" mantém essa preocupação social, mas muda o modus operandi, radicalizando uma certa virada para o histórico que o trabalho anterior do diretor, ""Sr. Turner"", já indicava. Mas se aquele filme era a biografia de um personagem conhecido, o pintor JMW Turner, em que Leigh utilizava o formato para fazer uma espécie de estudo de época, o novo longa adota um modelo mais clássico de filme histórico, se dedicando a reconstruir os eventos, bastidores e, principalmente, as versões que culminaram num momento crucial da história da luta por direitos sociais na Inglaterra, especialmente pelo direito ao voto. O maior acerto aqui, que também talvez seja o motivo para o filme não ter encontrado seu público, é que o tom que Leigh adota para o filme não tem nada de épico, grandioso ou emocional.     O diretor prefere resgatar aqueles contextos da forma mais documental que encontrou, contando a história a partir do retorno de dois personagens, um general e um soldado, da Batalha de Waterloo, em que a Inglaterra e seus aliados derrotaram Napoleão. A volta deles nos traz duas perspectivas sobre um país que passa uma grave crise de desemprego, miséria e fome, a dos governantes e a dos trabalhadores. Mas sua tentativa de registrar os primeiros movimentos populares para transformar aquele status quo rejeita uma visão polarizada do momento histórico. Há dois lados muito claros, mas há dezenas de outros lados dentro de cada um deles, o que ajuda a entender a colcha de movimentações políticas que existia ali. Esse tom discreto é quase uma surpresa diante da evidente celebração de um momento histórico que o diretor opera. Até a trilha e a fotografia dos companheiros de longa data de Leigh, Gery Yershon e Dick Pope, que sempre são muito evidentes em seus filmes, estão mais comedidas.  No entanto, apesar destas escolhas enriquecerem a construção, elas são bastante arriscadas porque talvez não entreguem para quem assiste ao filme a chance do envolvimento emocional, o que pode, para muita gente, aproximar o filme dos livros de história que só se lia por obrigação. Uma escolha interessante neste sentido é a falta de protagonistas. Há vários personagens importantes, mas a ação sempre está diluída entre eles, sem que heróis e vilões sejam facilmente reconhecidos. Aliás, eles até são, mas de uma maneira muito menos óbvia. Leigh aposta, inclusive, em atores pouco conhecidos ou identificáveis. Não há nenhum Timothy Spall nem um Jim Brodabent, negando ao espectador rostos familiares aos quais se apegar. A intenção parece mesmo ser fazer com que a versão que ele se propõe a contar sobre aqueles eventos históricos esteja em primeiro plano, sem muitos subterfúgios. Mas aí vem aquela questão: quem liga pra História hoje em dia, não é mesmo? Numa época em que o imediatismo, o discurso de força e o estado de violência são celebrados em todo o mundo, um filme que se dedica a reconstruir contextos históricos ainda faz sentido? Pensei muito em ""Bacurau"" durante a sessão por vários motivos porque é um filme que, de certo modo, representa o completo oposto de ""Peterloo"". Primeiro porque ele também é uma obra poderosa sobre como o homem simples, o trabalhador, se revolta contra a tirania e o massacre social. Segundo porque enquanto Mike Leigh preferiu o estilo documental para validar seu resgate, o longa de Kleber Mendonça Filho e Juliano Dornelles,  também fundamentalmente político, se apropria dos recursos do cinema de gênero para estabelecer contextos e resgatar um histórico de revolta social celebrando a herança do Cangaço. Terceiro porque, ao adotar esse formato mais ficcional e ao mesmo tempo mais popular, ""Bacurau"" encontrou sua voz e ""Peterloo"" falou para poucos.  Eu, que trabalho em televisão há longos anos, entendo bem que o sucesso é medido pela audiência. E que, hoje em dia, com tanto conteúdo oferecido por aí, com tanta possibilidade de distração e com tanto engajamento de Facebook, encontrar uma maneira de se comunicar mais diretamente e de forma mais lúdica com o público talvez seja uma forma eficaz de despertar um estado de desconforto e de revolta existente por aí e também um modo mais saboroso de fazer valer suas ideias. Não que isso invalide maneiras aparentemente mais tradicionais de se fazer um cinema político. ""Peterloo"", pelos mais variados motivos, é um belo e arriscado filme.

The grand scale of Mike Leigh's film and its roster of characters feel familiar. As do the mirrored worlds of towering wealth and grinding poverty, a theme which Dickens stamped indelibly on the English soul, if not its conscience. What makes this interesting is that all of the treacly sweetener of Dickens has been stripped away from this story. There is no angelic woman to serve as the chaste love interest, elevating a protagonist through courtly Providence. No uplifting elements for anyone at the end. And God is most definitely not on the side of the oppressed in this story. This is a gloves-off, thorough examination of why you're down and you're going to stay down.  Much like a Dickens novel, this is highly dependent on how much you're willing to listen to a lot of talking. I've seen the knock on this film being its many, many speeches throughout its 2 1/2 hour runtime. I don't doubt it bores quite a few people to tears, just as the florid and unhurried reams of dialogue do in something like A Tale of Two Cities, which this has lineage to. There are those that enjoy the writing style, and there are those like myself who find the speeches here to be engaging. They're what tell the story, but not necessarily from their content. Much of the reformers' rhetoric is lofty, highfalutin, and barely distinguishable from speaker to speaker. The story is in the intonation of the boilerplate, the expressions on each man and woman's face as they get closer to something that they cannot take back, and the reactions of the crowd as things get more and more frenzied. Some of the speeches are genuinely moving even with the committee-approved verbiage feel of them, and you learn to tell the difference between a man like the preening and self-important Henry Hunt (Rory Kinnear) and the rougher, more honest Samuel Bamford (Neil Bell).  The establishment gets their chance to speechify as well, and a lot of the dark humor is courtesy of villainous magistrates composing thundering retorts to the poor laborers' rhetoric in their correspondence and with each other, putting careful touches on their prose to make sure that they sound as crushing and ruthless as possible. The strength of a large, epic cast is to humanize, and even the powers-that-be, intent on grinding the working class under their heel, are not a monolithic assemblage. Some chew the courthouse scenery as they talk divine retribution and blood and iron, and some express serious misgivings about the implications of violence and abandoning the rule of law. A range of humanity is on display on both sides, and watching the more militant elements gain more and more acceptance on both sides sends this film on a one-way path to its climactic tragedy.  The massacre itself is harrowing, and Leigh spends almost every moment building toward it. When it finally arrives, you're going to feel that violence personally. The camerawork brings it home, situated on the ground, looking up at the charging horses and the sabers flashing down. And by this time you know most of the people who are going to die here. Looking down on the carnage are the assembled city fathers, decked out smartly in black business attire, sporting a pair of opera glasses that remind one of Pasolini. Perhaps the most vicious detail of all is that it's the yeomanry, the guys who are from the same towns and therefore recognize and are recognized by many of the protestors, who are the ones who start the violence, and the ones who conduct themselves most savagely. This stands in stark contrast to the professional soldiers in their red coats and muskets, who are far more restrained in their response. This is a deeply personal massacre, on a number of different levels, and as a spectacle it's a very impressive crescendo to Leigh's production.  Peterloo brings a chill to the spine. There's no redemption at the very end of this, which fits the historical narrative. Nothing concrete was achieved by the massacre, except to embolden the authorities to crack down harder on radical movements. Reformers eventually gain the upper hand years later, but it's hard to take much comfort from that when faced with the blood of women and children in a trampled field. This is a story of how a movement gets systematically taken apart; weakened and harried at key points by goons and informers, misdirected, penetrated, and ultimately crushed by physical force. That's a real rough tale to spin with people who we spend this much intimate time with, and it ought to resonate. The same dynamics explored so intently here are not somehow limited to the 19th century. I'll bet there's some folks in Hong Kong right now who would recognize a lot of these plot points.  This is a hard film to love, which is likely why it's being so slept on by everyone. This is an unpleasant story, told in a manner that is very stylized and thus prone to dismissal by those who don't have the taste. There's a reason, though, why Leigh chose to tell this story at this time, and it's not because he wanted to show off his skills at directing crowds and his army of costumers.",6,20,0,411,"1,073","22 Jul, 2019"

Every scrap of historical detail about Lancashire and Manchester reformists in the late 1810s has made its way into this two and half hour film, making it both very informative and terminally boring. Leigh takes a documentary-style, steadfastly refusing to have anything approaching a main character, and instead getting the perspective of a vast number of figures in the build up to, and day of, the 1819 Peterloo massacre. The headline names are Maxine Peake (as poverty-stricken working mum Nellie) and Rory Kinnear (as famous orator Henry Hunt), but they get little more screen time than anyone else. Though this paints a well-rounded picture of the various sides involved at Peterloo, we’re not given enough time with anyone to invest in them. Town hall meetings go on forever, every speaker ending their address by announcing the following speaker until it feels like Leigh is mocking you – there are an embarrassing number of superfluous scenes. At least half an hour needed to be cut in a far less lax edit, and the studied, period-accurate language gets in the way of a lot of the performances. Peterloo itself only takes up the final 20 minutes of Peterloo, and your patience will have already expired by the time this bland finale rolls around. The scale of the event isn’t successfully recreated, and any attempt to convey the chaos ends up coming across as simply bad choreography. It’s sad to say, but with Peterloo, Mike Leigh has dropped the most disappointing film of the year. After Mr Turner, its potential was huge, but it fails to live up to almost any expectations.

Mike Leigh returns to historical drama again after the sensational -- fight me -- Mr. Turner in this epic yarn about one of the bloodiest moments in Britain's existence, the namesake massacre which has been relegated to dusty textbooks for all but the most ardent scholars and historians. Leigh is a director and storyteller who can make even a 200-year-old event seem timely and urgent, and it's exactly what he does in Peterloo. Though it at times gets bogged down in too many stoggy characters, and could be better served with an edit or two amidst its dry tone, this period film brings alive a moment of insurrection by the working class, done by a filmmaker championing such forgotten people in a country which routinely denigrates them to second-class citizenry. In the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, in the second decade of the 1800s, England is at a crossroads. Once again the power of Europe after the commanding victory on the continent, nevertheless the poor and working class men and women of the nation suffer greatly in this new industrial age where their labor is exploited, their lives are ignored, and their wages are slashed to profit the rich. For petty crimes, tax evasions, and illegalities of necessity and poverty, citizens are routinely beaten, jailed, exiled, or executed. In the city of Manchester especially, a rising tide of anger and populist rage boils amongst the working men who beg for a representative voice in Parliament. In this petition for expanded voting rights and reform of tax laws, which leads to a rousing but peaceful protest of 60,000 people one August day in 1819, the government responded with unrelenting force and violence at Peter's Field, in what would become known as the Peterloo Massacre where a thousand were wounded and nearly twenty killed. I didn't mention a single character in this summary, and I presume Mike Leigh would have enjoyed that. Peterloo is a film with dozens of characters whose names you may not remember, but whose words and deeds you will. Leigh does invent a family, a composite one of sorts, and blends this family and their contemporaries into real-life historical drama. Through powerful speeches and petitions, the British countrymen unite in the North of England against the corrupt nation which has exploited their labor, and join in a movement for universal suffrage. Other figures which Leigh uses in the film, some real politicians and some fictitious men, are cartoonishly villainous to an honestly laughable extent. ""We are their moral superiors!"" one actually says. Several scenes of these vile men speaking feel like the live version of political cartoons excoriating their behavior. From central casting of ""evil British twat,"" though surely based on fact their exaggerated mannerisms are hard to take seriously.  As a story of populist anger and rousing democratic reform, Peterloo succeeds on getting the tale right and giving the proper time to an atrocity too little-known but widely believed as a seminal turning point in British history. However, the dryness and stagey scenes with brutally exact exposition -- critic Glenn Kenny described it as ""standing stock still, and declaiming, as in poorly-directed theater"" -- feel clichéd and too on-the-nose, even derivative in their direct and simple portrayal. Cinematography by Dick Pope is static, quite literally many times with zero camera moment, in stark contrast to the dynamism of many Leigh films. The final climactic scene of the massacre itself is a chaotic and harrowing one, well-shot and well-staged for an event which only exists in newspaper clippings and history books. But overall it's a mixed bag with an ensemble cast of names I do not know and dialogue which alternates between elevated and bland. That a period piece of anti-capitalist and pro-democratic drama was acquired by the vile Amazon for $18 million, which subsequently must have lost them millions on its poor reception and dismal box office… feels oddly fitting and ironic at the same time.

It's a tidy summation of the two-pronged aim of at least three quarters of the film - even the most well-intentioned passion coexists with a sense of ego - but it also feels like a dare to the audience. It's not an emotional provocation to see the impending violence like something like Detroit so miserably attempted but rather a resignation that history doesn't happen with the poetry that it's afforded in so many books or paintings. It's not just grisly, but awkward, and prone to the whims of confusion and the idiocy of a few scared men cowering at a windowsill at the scant possibility of change. Leigh makes you feel the length of Peterloo, supplying nearly every character and class of people with their own fiery (and often redundant) rhetoric that moves their individual audience - and crucially, feels totally absent of specifics. They have the passion, but don't begin to have the tools to enact change and so everything is talk. It's conversation that's often boring and tedious and filtered like a game of telephone until an errant spud becomes a lethal missile. And whether it's the Manchester Female Reform (featured in a beautiful scene that shows a nascent but vital movement) or orator Hunt (a real piece of work), they both showcase a type of ineffective politicking that's less advocating for violence than directness. Relatedly, there's no end credit post-script that justifies what happens in the film. The people affected are still years away from any kind of valuable change or the hope of a better life. There's a possibility that the climax of this could have felt redundant, but it doesn't. The escalations feel totally spontaneous in a way that's expansive without being simply about the scope. Instead, it happens in such a way that the only right ending is to return to the humility of the loss of a single life away from the constant speechifying and its mythic historical weight.",4,6,0,228,474,"13 Jul, 2019"

There was a time in my life when a film like this would've bored me to tears. Suffrage, insurrection, political rhetoric, tax relief, parliamentary reform, etc. all wrapped in period-piece psychology. Ugh. Had I watched this film twenty years ago I would've deeply felt that ""ugh"" in my bones without fully recognizing how privileged my life had been, and still is. The genre itself would've contributed to my indifference, too, and while I still feel that ""ugh"" about a significant number of them, I've also become really interested in class struggle and economic strife over the years, and feel as though my eyes have opened to the moral and spiritual centers that make up the topic. Many of the filmmakers I've studied, in fact, feel passionately about this theme, and that passion has had a very humanizing effect on my mind.  Haneke opened my eyes to a critique of middle-class bourgeois families, and how this group historically developed a crisis in European conscience. He's devoted the majority of his career to pricking said conscience and confronting those who refuse to confront the uncomfortable truths of the past, so it should come as little wonder why his films are constantly penetrated by otherness and strange invaders. Buñuel reinforced the power of satirizing social groups, specifically the church and the bourgeois, and how satire is best used to unveil faux piety and moral hypocrisy. Fassbinder improved the way I view class structures, outsiders, victims and victimizers, the way I contemplate deep-rooted prejudices towards race, sex, and sexual orientation, the way I see terrorism grow on the political right as well as political left, and overall the way I think about systems that fail and abuse people. The Dardenne Brothers, bless their souls, have shown me the raw, psychological and spiritual impacts of those struggling with slave labor, unemployment, immigration adjustment, and the general despair that accompanies the working class life. Then there's Leigh, another champion of the working class, whose films have repeatedly grounded me with empathy towards those on the margins of society. His films place a human face on those abandoned by their government, and in the best way invite me to learn about people suffering with political and social conditions I've never experienced. The link that binds all these filmmakers? Reform. And it's the kind of reform that sees inequality among class structures and either a). reacts against those who would oppose reform, to the point of wounding the conscience of the tyrannically elite, or b). sympathizes with those who wish for reform but are too weighed down by the cudgels of grief, hunger, poverty, unemployment, etc. to make a better life.  PETERLOO is a film that embodies the spirit of both the aggressor and the sympathizer, a story that hopes for reform as much as it militates against those who would oppose it. It's loaded with talk, talk, talk but don't be fooled. These words are powerful weapons, the kind that can raise the consciousness of an oppressed class and lead them to revolt. Leigh's sympathies extend backwards to the disenfranchised of yesteryear, but also extend forward to our own world. The past is a mirror in his film by which memory and responsibility converge with the present, then beckons us to act. It's an epic story told in a simple, stripped down way. A completely lived-in world that textures time with inspired details. It critiques the complacency of upper and middle class power, while at the same time mourns with those at the bottom seeking modest wages and political access. I predict this would be a film Haneke, Buñuel, Fassbinder, and the Dardenne Brothers would all love. Leigh Ranked",7,24,3,52,864,"30 Dec, 2019"

It starts off by showing fallen soldiers at the battle of Waterloo. Very serious subjects are alleviated with humor. At times, it seems almost inappropriate or conflicting with the ultimate intended tone. However, Mike Leigh is a master director and we can just let it slide and say that the laughs are there for comic relief.  The main subject is inequality. It mirrors a present day political issue in the USA: the government is fat while its citizens are lean. Everyday people are trying to figure out whether or not to get involved by protesting or if they should resort to violence. They're also trying to decide which voices to listen to. Krzysztof Kieslowski's Three Colors series (Red, White, and Blue) focuses on following the lives of the survivors of a tragic accident. Peterloo reverses this, instead following those that will eventually perish [not exactly a spoiler, since it isn't 100% obvious which ones will die].  Also, it has been almost two years since the Manchester Arena bombing. This is another true story set in Manchester where people were senselessly killed. Leigh brings this forgotten piece of history to light. Perhaps I prefer Leigh's family dramas, but anyone who's an Anglophile or political or interested in history and/or good filmmaking will find this film worthwhile.

That sums it up. Mike Leigh directs the seldom-told Massacre of Peterloo with care and conviction, emphasising the abhorrent injustices of the tragedy and condemning those responsible for their involvement that caused the unprovoked deaths of 18 and injuries of many more. With a collection of solid performances that convey the pain and trouble of the time, and strong production and costume design, it’s a sympathetic examination that still feels all too rare in our cinematic landscape. But it is a flawed piece. The screenplay is tiring, with heavy-handed dialogue that paints caricatures which, in turn, are played theatrically, arguably diluting the impact of the intense, painful story at the film’s heart. It rather discordantly leans to comedy at irregular intervals, causing a sense of tonal whiplash that undercuts the drama and weight of the situation. And there’s no denying that this film runs on a little bit too long; the titular massacre does not arrive until close to the second hour and, particularly in the middle act, it’s a little bit of a slog to endure. It’s honestly exhausting at times. While I have no wish to see it, I’m glad I experienced Peterloo. Its real-life tragedy should not be wiped from our history books and its relevancy today - around two hundred years later - is startling and disappointing. Mike Leigh executes with fervour and zeal - but doesn’t quite win the battle.",5,5,0,360,"1,235","08 Nov, 2018"

It's not just the dialect of the characters that is carefully cultivated to be as authentic as possible, but the specific words they use and the context in which they use them, which is scrutinised and debated as it slowly forms the web that is eventually untangled in the shocking, frenzied climax.  Organising people is hard. Especially when those people are hungry and angry. The arduous, ugly procedure of arranging a revolution is the main focus for the bulk of the film, as we watch the clandestine gatherings and the rousing speeches countered by continual misunderstanding, naivety and squabbling, particularly in relation to words and what they mean. Leigh makes the case here that while words may be the weapon of the lower class, they are powerless if they don't know how to use them. And even then, it's all very well and good to say the pen is mightier than the sword, but it matters who is holding the sword.  The amount of effort that goes into showing the working classes' painstaking struggle to fight the system using any means at their disposal, only to have them breezily crushed by the powers that be, borders on satire, especially given how much of a total caricature all the figures of authority are. The lower class are also a little thin in terms of characterisation but that seems more of a by-product of Leigh's insistence that the period authenticity be airtight, thus scrimping a bit on making the actual people three-dimensional. Though there's a satirical edge throughout the film before it goes all-out in the finale (there's a Life of Brian reference, for goodness sake), we do get some emotional stuff from the scenes of community amongst our working class heroes. Even if the endless machinations of the working class to dismantle the oppressive forces ultimately amount to nothing - no reform, no change - the act is still bringing them together, unifying them and allowing them to share and empathise with each other. Still, this is but a small glimmer of goodness in an inescapable world of ceaseless tyranny and Sisyphean hopelessness. Peterloo is passionate and stirring, but less as a rousing power-to-the-people piece of propaganda and more a furious ""fuck-the-government"" statement. In a social climate that is increasingly blatant in its disdain for the rich and the injustice of wealth and class disparity, Peterloo is particularly bitter. The ending is unflinchingly - borderline hysterically - brutal and bleak. It's ironic in a way that goes right past snarky into enraged. You could argue it's histrionic and too on-the-nose, but anything subtler would have made for a less memorable film. Mike Leigh isn't in the mood for stagey period nonsense, he's kicking arse and taking names. I will also say the ending to this fucked me up far more than I had anticipated. I see the value in content warnings but I don't know if being told to expect a baby getting trampled to death by a horse would have quite prepared me.",5,6,0,470,552,"27 Jan, 2020"

For some, it may appear as a clear assurance that Leigh has gone on some sort of historical route (spoiler, he has probably not!) and many will feel fatigued by what is essentially a 2,5-hour montage of lengthy, political speeches from people you might not even remember by the end of the film. It’s true that Peterloo may be one of Leigh’s least accessible films. He doesn’t single out any clear leads and instead creates a dense cast of many smaller characters who each get their time and space to do their thing. There aren’t any relatable characters in that sense as there’s hardly any time to relate to any specific character. In the case of Peterloo, Leigh doesn’t want to try and make you sympathize with any individuals but instead make you aware of the mistreatment of a larger group of people, indeed, a large part of society. Thematically Leigh hasn’t changed a bit, however. But where his most beloved films showed his feelings for the working class’ through his usual dramatic sensibilities, Peterloo is deliberately made to feel dry and dour. This doesn’t take away Leigh’s knack for character as any and every person on screen looks and talks as if they were transported straight from the 19th century. While they may not undergo the character-development we’re used to seeing in his films, together they do form an important portrait of a part of society that he’s all too familiar with. For the things that keep us up today aren’t very different from what they were back then. Leigh’s humble epic makes a not so subtle comparison to our modern times. The imbalance between the high lords of politics and the common man is shown vividly and a lot of time is spent showing the ways in which both sides prepare for battle. And yes, that battle is made up almost entirely of words. Orations, speeches, rousing the public with your voice! When, at the very end, the infamous massacre does take place, it is shown to be an act of pure cowardice, as those in control are too scared to let their place of power be taken in a righteous way. The Peterloo Massacre is only one of many instances in history showing a class struggle get completely out of hand, merely because people are too scared to share power and control with others. It won’t take long before films like this will be made on “les gilet jaunes”. The fact alone that Leigh felt the need to make this film now, shows that we have still a long way to go. While his film may not have the expected (or necessary) sense of drama to really shake up its viewing audience - even the massacre feels somewhat shallow despite some gruesome shots throughout -, it does tell its story in a rightful manner and in the end that may be the best we could want from a film like this. Nowhere near Leigh’s best but in any case a solid drama, deserving of deeper analysis and appreciation in times to come. Hopefully, the wait for such analyses won’t take too long, as we’ve all waited long enough already.",4,15,0,962,"2,477","07 Mar, 2019"
