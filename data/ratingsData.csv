It is cleverly edited by Nelson Rodriquez to alarmingly confront and instruct the world to the then-contemporary political climate of the country, and it could almost serve as a passionate and quietly affecting semi-autobiographical work from it's writer and director. It combines actual news footage and archival photographs, and it frequently spotlights the essence of the nation in a poignant light while treating the nineteen-sixties as a period of history for the country as one defined by considerable enthusiasm and unprecedented motivation. It wields a sincere and athletic moral principle to forge itself as a work of great importance, and it's one of the most impressive films of Cuban cinema; which unsurprisingly, collected numerous awards at international film festivals.",2,52,0,"6,764","12,332",8-Jun-20,rated-9

The answer to the sacrifice is rarely ""all of ourselves"" because we are too selfish and arrogant. As much as this film is a character study and study of an era and study of a country, it is a study of nothing - the most problematic aspect of modern living. One of the most definitive and comprehensive portraits of the 1960s served in true cinematic fashion. Perhaps because this film is so good and big, my mind wanders to think about the lost ability to capture so much in one film. This is much bigger debate and it's just gut-feeling but I kind of miss films that shamelessly tried to reach to every aspect of their time and those people. Today in most cases films only bother capture a little, one side of something - that is not to say that they can't do this very well. In a sense the best of 60s cinema feels more vitalistic simply because filmmakers tried to understand ways of seeing and potential of cinema was reshaping on so many different fields. The reason why we are looking back in awe at the 60s is that these films haven't lost any of their characterizing power - even if their creators were proudly and (a tad) uncritically the children of their era.",2,3,0,226,"2,089",2-Oct-19,rated-9

Maybe I'm just too ignorant about the Cuban Revolution to properly appreciate such a counterintuitive portrait, with its focus squarely on the semi-decadent non-adventures of a bourgeois pseudo-intellectual.

Memories of Underdevelopment is hailed for its importance in Cuban cinema but Tomás Gutiérrez Alea's stunning concoction of filmmaking techniques and his ability to simultaneously champion and criticise the very revolution he supports makes it truly worthy of the acclaim. Combining documentary footage with elements of Free Cinema realism, New Wave experimentation and montage, Alea's film draws on European arthouse as much as it does on contemporary American film but somehow it all fits together like an immaculately assembled jigsaw. In the wake of the revolution, Sergio inexplicably decides to stay in Cuba, whilst all his family and friends leave in order to preserve their privileged lifestyle and we see this shallow intellectual wander the streets aimlessly, nostalgic for the past and unsure of how he fits into this new society—confused and frustrated, now only able to define his worth by relationships with women that expose him as nothing but a self-absorbed chauvinist. If we sympathise with him at any point, which is entirely possible given the persuasive use of subjectivity and his utterly passive involvement, then that perhaps suggests there are flaws with the new regime which shouldn't be ignored. Alea's imagery and deployment of allegory is incredible given what seems like a spontaneous creation and some of it was indeed pure chance, such as the shot of Sergio walking the opposite direction through a crowd of demonstrators—the symbolism of which speaks for itself and the telescope mounted high up from his balcony, which he uses to voyeuristically peer down and criticise, wasn't in the script either. Then there's the shot of Sergio through a telephoto lens that zooms in on his face until it begins to literally decompose, the exact same shot Bergman used on Max von Sydow in the final scene of The Passion of Anna the following year—an interesting coincidence? This is a film of scathing honesty and audacious introspection that asks important questions with sophistication and fascinating insight—it may be specific to a time and place, but its appeal is universal.

I find it very difficult to know quite what it is doing, to pin it down, but that is what makes it interesting. A film of the Revolution, about Revolutionary Cuba: a political film, but not a polemic. Sergio (Sergio Corrieri) sees his parents and wife off at the airport: they are heading for Miami, but Sergio is staying in Havana. It is the early 1960s. As another character later says, Sergio is neither a revolutionary nor a counter-revolutionary. He is obviously from a privileged background. His friend Pablo (Omar Valdes) is cynical about the new order: he and Sergio share a past life, maybe they were playboys, but now Pablo bores Sergio: this is a past he wants to rid himself of. In an ‘essay’ sequence about the Bay of Pigs Sergio explains the different types of bourgeoisie who supported the counter-Revolution, but it is left open where he might sit. Sergio dabbles as a writer, goes to a revolutionary writers’ forum, but it is difficult to know if he is part of this or just a dilettante. And all the time he lives comfortably, not working, living on the rents from his properties. Much of the film is centred on his relationships with a number of women. We see him with his wife (Yolanda Farr), their relationship collapsing: this could be taken symbolically as Sergio distancing himself from the old bourgeoisie, rejecting his old life, but it is difficult to take this as a positive move: he seems haunted by her, listening to an argument that he taped. He tells of a relationship in his youth with Hannah (Ingar Seeland), the daughter of German refugees fleeing from the Nazis: he describes their relationship as though she was the great love of his life, but when she leaves Batista’s dictatorship with her family, he stays behind to manage a furniture shop: it was a potential life he turned his back on. Most importantly there is Elena (Daisy Granados), a young woman he picks up: she is like one of the young women out of Godard’s 1960s films, Chantal Goya in Masculine feminine: she is a consumerist, enjoying clothes: she is bored by Sergio’s cultural pretensions: finally she is charmingly shallow. She could be seen as a symbol of a non- or anti-Revolutionary youth entranced by foreign luxury and a consumerist lifestyle...but that is not how it plays. Sergio is the seducer, the middle class man pursuing the girl from a poorer background. And when he gets bored with her he shuts her out. One of the great emotional uncertainties about the film is that we are aligned with Sergio, while constantly being distanced from his actions. (Or, to put it another way, he is an unsympathetic hero...or a non-heroic hero.) And he has erotic fantasies about his cleaner, Noemi (Eslinda Nunez). Whatever his ambitions for reforming himself and aligning himself with the Revolution, they are constantly exposed by his responses to those about him, who are often used or objectified. Part of our alignment with Sergio is formed by the constant use of an inner narration: we have access to Sergio’s thoughts. I presume much of this is taken directly from Edmundo Desnoes’ novel (he has written the script), but what we see is not limited to illustrating the inner voice; however, the visual does not work in opposition, it does not create irony; rather it constantly contextualizes the narration, showing greater intricacies in the occurrences than Sergio describes: it constantly opens his narration up to new views and interpretations. And I think it is here that the richness of the film lies, but also the uncertainty. The film is an investigation of the tensions between the actions of Sergio’s personal life and the political context of Revolutionary Cuba – slightly tritely, we could say the film is about the conflict of the personal and the political, and the way the personal undermines the political if it is not itself politicized. On one viewing I am uncertain whether the film fully expresses both levels of meaning, whether the story of Sergio and the story of the Revolution are brought together in a satisfactory way...but that might be the point of the film: the lack of integration in the film indicating an openness of the political future. (And, I realize, I have not indicated the zest of Gutierrez Alea’s filmmaking. The way the film moves from dramatizations to essay documentary is obviously deeply influenced by Godard, but Alea draws on the influence in an individualistic way: it is as though early non-political Godard and later political Godard were coming together into the same film as conflict. And the film, like many low budget films from the 1960s and ‘70s, has a roughness in technique: there are ambitious camera movements that remain slightly wobbly. I like this: it exposes the technology of the filmic process. It seems impossible today: maybe the technology is just too good, so now filmmakers like Lars von Trier just have to fake formal roughness.) May 2014",2,3,0,7,66,2/8/16,rated-9

As someone living in the United States, and who went to school here, my understanding of cultures and history that isn’t predominantly skewed to the white American perspective was pretty low coming out of high school, and would still be low if I didn’t actively work to seek out other avenues of education. International cinema provides so much value, especially when you can use the works of these filmmakers as fuel to then go and research the background of the countries where these films were made and the social/political climate that informed the works. It’s invigorating, and something that Scoresese’s World Cinema Project highlights in great detail, bringing films from some of the obvious bigger countries like China and South Korea, but also including significant works from countries like Brazil, Senegal, and the Philippines, places whose cinema rarely, if ever, gets the kind of exposure that the WCP can give them.  Tomás Gutiérrez Alea’s Memories of Underdevelopment takes place in post-revolution Cuba as a bourgeois novelist (Sergio Corrieri) spends his time wandering about the city, reflecting on his memories of his wife and the changing times of Cuba while occasionally getting into romantic encounters with other women. It’s got this great blend of Resnais and Fellini going on, with Alea merging real documentary footage of the events in Cuba with the ramblings of this self-centered arrogant prick, evidence that you can make a great movie with an extremely unlikable protagonist. “Underdevelopment” is shown to take many stages in Alea’s film, from the state of the country’s political and social structures to its government to the main character as a human being and in his relationships with women. He, ironically, refers to the women he’s seeing as being underdeveloped, when in reality it’s only his own toxic perspective that treats them as inferior to himself for no reason other than his perceived superiority that’s been ingrained in him through the patriarchal system.  There’s a long sequence in the film detailing a rape trial between Sergio and one of these women, and since we see the film through Sergio’s perspective/experience, it almost feels like the movie is trying to get us to side with him. Really though, it’s a shrewd way of trojan horsing a scathing indictment of the criminal justice system in Cuba, and the oppression of women that is magnified by it. Memories of Underdevelopment could almost be mistaken for being slight, but it’s the kind of movie that only impresses more and more the longer that it ruminates with you and the more you begin to dissect everything that you saw within it. Like Fellini, the way that we follow Sergio as he aimlessly wander the world feels casual, but eventually you realize that his aimlessness is only capable from the sheer privilege of his bourgeois standing, while the entire country is in absolute chaos around him.

I think he communicated the larger message of contradiction in the socialist transition phase from capitalism to socialism. In the film's 'new-wave' style and the main character acting as a narcissistic writer, both communicate the same kind of cultural deadlock a revolution faces against a reified capitalist world. In other words, our imaginations are limited by the base ideology until a revolution plays out, gains power, fails, tries again, starts over, etc.. The creepy bourgeois writer doesn't become a Che Guevara character overnight. Ideology changes over time along with the economic superstructures that can only really change with the base.

In which there is a character driven story within the confines of the political environment of a certain nation. With the politics being a driving factor in the character story. In this film, it is Cuba during the 50s and 60s, at the height of its Revolution that would last decades afterwards. I'll speak subjectively for a bit. Because I find this film to be quite contemporary with the situation in my home country of Venezuela. In fact, a lot of this film reminded me of the environment around me when I lived there as a child. One easily being the anti-imperialist message against the United States. I guess I'll provide some of that context right now as best I can. Without deviating too much from the film... Many in Venezuela, and certainly in other countries around the world, look at the United States as the world police that does not need to intervene everywhere. Naming them imperialist who only want to have control over countries around them. With certain reason, given one example of it is the situation in the Bay of Pigs around the time the film is depicting. To show how this still continues, I still vividly remember as a kid seeing billboard signs on a highway that depicted George W. Bush as the devil incarnate. It's that serious. It has been present for decades, and continues to be so today. Hence why this film feels contemporary in its message. Although, as far as I know, it hasn't been censored in any way here in the United States, that's certainly surprising given its theme and presentation of the U.S. With it having a Blu-ray release in a couple of months, it is kind of exciting seeing something like this being shown to as many people who are interested. Besides that. The film itself is quite good. Again, it's essentially a character study of an individual during this era in Cuba, and how events surrounding this character affects his lifestyle and decisions, and the decisions of those around them. Shockingly enough, the story has a fascinating moment near the end that I won't say anything about. It really came out of left field and caught my eye. This is a good one. Again, I'm kind of excited that it can even be shown without any censors in a country that the film essentially vilifies to some extent. Blessed be The World Cinema Project!

Its stark alienation naturally reminds one of Antonioni's modernist masterworks, as its hero, Sergio, inhabits stark, urban spaces (his apartment building a lifeless concrete monolith on the outside, lifelessly but ever so tastefully decorated on the inside) that increasingly come to feel like prisons. But the fact that Sergio's alienation plays out against Cuba's post-revolutionary backdrop aligns the film also with works ranging from Visconti's Senso and Bertolucci's Before the Revolution to Garrel's Regular Lovers, films brimming with revolutionary zeal, but focused on upper-class individuals so trapped by their own bourgeois trappings and intimate desires that their collective's dreams become nothing but the vague background for their own personal failures. Sergio wanders post-revolutionary Havana, its streets emptied by so many of the upper-class who fled to Florida, a disaffected intellectual with nowhere to go and nothing to do. He remembers his childhood, a past idyllic affair, and also his tumultuous marriage, while also pursuing the younger, working-class Elena (an affair that ends in a dramatic courtroom scene). Everywhere and everyone outside of himself he sees as so much stagnation and ""underdevelopment"" (In the tropics, everything ripens and decomposes in a day”), a people and a land unable to grow, caught between Russia and the United States, the disconnected intelligentsia and the unending impoverishment of actual material conditions. And Sergio, the disaffected man whose seen it all and knows all the answers, proves not immune to this condition, his own impotence and lethargy the film's ultimate condemnation, before it eerily ends by suggesting the possibility of sending the whole blighted land off into the void.",1,3,0,227,327,25-Jan-18,rated-8

While there are many stories about the political changes during that decade, what about the cultural and sexuality changes? This film explores both by following a man who is decently rich, but feels undestined. While there are some things that do not work in this film, I find it very interesting both from a story perspective and a filmmaking perspective. It tackles many political issues, sexism problems, and indifference of change. It handles these topics well, as the main character, though somewhat unlikable, is pretty realistic in a weird way, as he is does not care that much about politics and that his passion is more into girls... which can be extremely uncomfortable at times. The film is beautifully shot, it has a fantastic musical score and I love the style of the pacing. You can tell that this film took risks just by its production. My problem is the randomness of the film. There were several times where they would abruptly show a scene that had little to do with the story and it me lose focus at times. It may have something to do with the big picture of the message that the director wanted to send, but it still confused me. Memories of Underdevelopment was solid. It had thought-provoking ideas and it was very artistic. It gives you a glimpse of how life in the sixties were in Cuba.

Alea's efforts here make for an atmospheric and decaying environment, much of which is implied in quick montages and dialogue rather than ever seen bleeding into the world of its main character. Underdevelopment is often something he views at from a distance, at least underdevelopment in a more visceral or explicit sense. Cuba's state of affairs take hold on his behavior and his personal life, even in his relative avoidance of its uglier side. Underdevelopment less so kills the man, but it does take away his family, leaving him lost and alone in an uncertain future. Alea's experiments here as directors are maybe less refined or confident than some of his peers in political or social anger, whether that be Gavras, Pontecorvo, Cassavettes, Bertolucci, Brault, etc. His finest techniques and scenes, however, do stand strong amidst tougher company. Imposing shots of digressing actions of violence and suffering, an intense close-up growing so grainy that it becomes visually incomprehensible, seeing the country from an apartment's binoculars; it might not always be the most organized or sharpest film in its company, but it packs a real punch when needed.  Seeing underdevelopment in a seething, poetic light, of time in ambiguity and culture shuffling like playing cards, Memories of Underdevelopment strikes the same chords in ways similar films have done before and since its release. But framing it from this unique, towering bourgeois perspective while never sacrificing the atmosphere that makes an environment like this so imposing, it is a testament to Alea's skills as a director and as a storyteller. A worthy addition to cinema's angriest and tensest years yet.",6,13,4,483,"2,119",6-Mar-20,rated-8

Though it has a single protagonist, its meaning is far more general. Sergio is not meant to be an everyman: he is intelligent, cultured, and wealthy. His experience in Cuba is seen to be indicative of Cuba's experience, not a Cuban's experience. The triumph of entropy in ensuring Cuba's underdevelopment is indicted here, as the film captures Sergio's unfortunate inability to effect change in his country at all, despite his place in society. Cuba is seen as a country at odds with itself, where success and proper standing in the world are within reach but never reached for. Where many of the film's contemporaries are acerbic or angry in their political critique, Memories of Underdevelopment is almost lyrical, effortlessly extrapolating from Sergio's experience to illustrate its point about Cuba as a whole. Gutiérrez Alea's Cuba is a frustrating milieu. The film does not provide answers to assuage the frustration; instead, it expresses confusion regarding whether answers exist at all.",3,5,0,46,519,28-Mar-16,rated-9

I was taken aback on the ambivalence towards the actual revolution. Our intriguing protagonist seems to be invested in anything but the politics surrounding.  I really enjoyed the freeze frames, which was a fresh technique I haven't seen used in this way. In addition there were interesting editing choices, like looping certain actions, like a gif. I found this to be fresh as well, but also quite jarring. These technical aspects paired with the philosophical voiceovers created a pensive mood throughout the film, in light of political confusion. Terrific acting by the protagonist played by Sergio Corrieri. His performance was great and I could could gather a lot of emotion from his eyes. As for the narrative itself, I found it to be mostly bland or done better in other films. As SilentDawn writes, ""It's less a film about Cuba's transformation, more a character portrait of a man willing to commit and toss aside allegiances and relationships for his own emotional profit."" And there were multiple endings to the final act.

It's synopsis certainly gave it the potential to be painfully dry, but that was thankfully miles from the truth. Memories of Underdevelopment is a hell of a character study buried in a violently political, revolutionary Cuban setting. It sadly made me realize how ignorant I am to most of Cuban history. Some research and a revisit are definitely in order. This worked best for me as a study of a confused, horny man clinging on to Cuba as everything close to him drifts past. The message of the film felt less focused when it zoomed out to look at the greater issues of Cuba. I enjoyed these sequences much less.

Due to political upheaval, he doesn’t know what to write because, as a bourgeois playboy, he doesn’t know what his role is within new Cuba. Many films concerning writer’s block will tell lengthy, woeful details of a writer’s blockage. Alea lets you feel it. What’s ye olde writer’s adage? Show don’t tell. Cuba was romanticized by many American and European writers pre-Castro as a place to drink, work cheaply, and briefly fall in love with local women. After his wife and children have fled to America, Sergio pursues his own 16-year-old conquest, Elena (Daisy Granados); he dresses her in his wife’s European clothes and takes her to Ernest Hemingway’s former residence. He says Hemingway shot and mounted animals so that he wouldn’t have to kill himself. We feel that Sergio continues to live so he cannot be placed on a wall as a stuffed bourgeois bust. But Sergio cannot have an audience for his work because it is neither pro or anti regime. He sees both sides and that’s his blockage. Cuba’s most famous film from the 1960s was I am Cuba, but—as beautiful as it was—it was made by the Russian government. Memories of Underdevelopment is perhaps the most important Cuban film because it gives us a director who did indeed romanticize the revolution, but the isolation that came with it—through embargoes, and attempted invasions—had consequences for artists. Sergio wants to Europeanize Daisy, and Alea’s film feels akin in structure and despondent airiness to Italy’s 1960s post-Mussolini films from Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini. Sergio’s blockage comes from realizing outside influences will no longer be felt in Cuban art forms. And any isolated art form will become underdeveloped.",3,5,0,287,"1,958",10-Dec-17,rated-9

Every time something happens in America and one thinks, ""huh, that shouldn't be that way,"" I consider the fact that just south of us, are an entire collection of nations of similar world lineage, where things much worse have happened regularly, and yet they keep living on. Cuba might be my favorite of the region, if for nothing else because it was a fantastic exercise in what happens when all of the people who aren't with the program just leave one day. Like some sort of Rapture, with the punchline being that your afterlife gets to be Florida. Most of the people left at that point were on board with the ""don't fuck with us"" agenda of Castro, and you have to admire a nation founded on the principle of being a general pain in the ass to its much more powerful neighbor.  Tomás Gutiérrez Alea gives us a thoughtful look into post-Rapture Cuba. What kind of person left, what kind of person stayed, and the resulting shifts in culture and national attitudes. He's working with a solid source novel of the same name, and keeps much of the narrative structure, creating what might be thought of as a more bookish film, steeped in the interior thoughts of our protagonist Sergio (Sergio Corrieri), a Camus-like figure of terminal boredom and navel-gazing. You get why this needs to be a film, though, with the impressive staging of visuals, providing a great impression of the totality of the Cuban experience. The evolving streets of post-capitalist Havana, forested outskirts as seen by highway, government offices and lecture halls, beaches still filled with tourists, and the countryside surrounding the goofball attraction of Hemingway's vacation home. This is a story that desperately needs to be invested with feeling outside of Sergio's interminable introspection, and Alea's camera does a good job of it.  I enjoy how the theme of underdevelopment evolves as the story goes. The story begins with Sergio, high up above the bustle of Havana in his high-rise apartment, ruminating and looking down upon creation like The Omega Man, beset in his mind by the rabble and contenting himself by going through his various artworks. The more gullible are primed for a story about a terminally misunderstood man left in the wreckage of an ill-conceived revolution, and ""underdevelopment"" can be taken to mean the relative poverty of Cuba to its Western neighbor, as is explored in an incredibly silly panel discussion of intellectuals with cigars and pipes jammed into their mouths.  Sergio then meets Elena (Daisy Granados), a teenage bombshell who demonstrates that despite Sergio's studied intellectualism, he's just another dude looking to dip his wick when the opportunity arises. The concept of underdevelopment changes from one applied by the viewer to a nation, to one used by Sergio to consider his new teenage lover. He's frustrated by his inability to share what he considers to be his cultured world with her; she has no interest in art galleries, politics, literature, or anything else that Sergio has surrounded himself with in his attempts to ""live like a European."" Sergio considers Elena to be herself ""underdeveloped,"" though it certainly doesn't stop him from fucking her until he's gotten bored.  Sergio having demonstrated himself repeatedly to be a general asshole at this point, the true nature of underdevelopment comes to the fore, which is that of the protagonist, as shown by Alea. The viewer becomes more and more aware of Sergio's true nature. You'd assume at the beginning that he's a successful artist, but it turns out he's been living off the largesse of a family fortune, having made the decision to forsake the art life early on in favor of a life of indolence, collecting rents and profits for doing essentially nothing. Elena's family, generally pissed at the idea of a 38 year old man boning a 17 year old, takes Sergio to court for statutory rape, and he laments the fact that the justice system is now tilted towards the hoi polloi rather than wealthy men like himself. He's acquitted anyway, but consequences seem to be coming anyway for this man, who adds nothing to society and indulges his whims at the expense of others. Sergio himself is underdeveloped, implied to have some level of talent but choosing to instead piss it away and moan about his ennui all the time. The ending sequence, with Castro rallying the nation in the wake of the Cuban Missile Crisis as Sergio passively watches the preparations, demonstrates how thoroughly useless such a man is in this new place where most such people have been Raptured away.  They say that this film didn't find much of an audience in Cuba, where people probably pegged Sergio right off the bat as a parasite. It did, however, do gangbusters on the cinephile scene in America and Europe, where the journey might have resonated a little more. So many films and French novels start in the same place, after all. Latin America has long been able to school the rest of the hemisphere on how things really are, and I expect that they'll continue to do so for those interested in listening.",6,20,1,413,"1,080",3-Jan-20,rated-8

Set in Havana following the Bay of Pigs invasion (which, as seen at the film’s outset, triggered a mass exodus from the country in 1961), it’s characterized neither by outright dissent nor propagandist fervor, but by genuine uncertainty. (As such, it stands in glaring contrast to the fervent, rousing acrobatics of Mikhail Kalatozov’s I Am Cuba [1964], one of the most well-known Cuban films, despite being financed by the USSR.) Adapted from the novel by Edmundo Desnoes, the film focuses not on a member of the emancipated proletariat, but a member of the intellectual bourgeoisie: a writer named Sergio (Sergio Corrieri), who stays behind after his wife and elderly parents flee the country. That Gutiérrez Alea would choose a story with such a subject is less surprising when one considers that he himself was of a similar background. Raised in relative affluence, he received a law degree at a time when education was far from a given; he then studied cinema in Rome for a number of years before becoming involved with the ICAIC. In other words, like the film's protagonist, he didn't stand to gain much from Castro’s regime. But then, his relation to the revolution had never been one of uncritical embrace or outright rejection. Although Gutiérrez Alea hewed to the ICAIC’s foundational view of cinema as a means for social betterment, he assessed his role as ""a man who makes criticism inside the revolution, who wants to ameliorate the process, to perfect it, but not to destroy it”—a view certainly borne out by his legacy. Seen today, it's not difficult to understand the enduring reputation of Memories. In 1968, when the film was made, both the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis, which bookend the story’s timeline, were already in the (recent) past, a fact that suffuses the film with the unique lucidity of hindsight. The title is no deception. It’s suggestive of both Sergio's own memories of a pre-revolutionary Cuba and a portrait of post-1959 Havana as it would have looked to then-contemporary audiences. Incorporating archival footage, documentary-like sequences, playful flights of fancy and prickly moral ambiguity, the film fused a kind of nouvelle vague playfulness with elements of what would become known as the Latin American “Third Cinema” movement—which, broadly speaking, rejected both the commercial Hollywood model and (European) auteur-centric methods in favour of a focus on revolutionary or social change...'

Everything falls into place: Sergio's patronizing, bourgeois  attitude, the rape trial that follows, the awful things people say about Elena trying to assert that she was raped, and the seduction in general. This is Alea's critique of Cuba, in the moment. He's declaring that his country should not try to be what it once was, nor should it allow its current flaws be excused. He's taking a sharp look at everything, despite having a clear appreciation for his country. This film is a collage, as is mentioned in the very midst of the film, at times literally, but always metaphorically. It has cut various facets of Cuba's post-revolutionary society up and pasted them onto the film so that we experience this poetic but occasionally grainy impression of the entirety of the nascent country's sedate turmoil. In the midst of forging its own path, sandwiched between two giants, and bearing the weight of a significant moment in modern history, it somehow has room for breath, an impressive display of normality. We just watch as Sergio goes about him almost aimless existence, but in truth, we're seeing Cuba in those moments. Its bourgeois past, its troubled present, its potential futures all unfold as Alea addresses with complexity the state of the island. Like Sergio, he takes no apparent political stance, but unlike Sergio, there is an apparent appreciation for Cuba itself regardless. May count: 20/30. Country: Cuba.

I was reminded of lots of Italian cinema throughout, especially Antonioni (which came before) and Petri and Ferreri (which came after). But this is also a movie about Cuba specifically and no other revolution, which makes it unique as a cinematic vision. The movie would make a great double feature with a film I just watched, The War Is Over, Resnais’s contemporary work about a freedom fighter in Franco’s Spain, though that film’s central character is more interesting and the filmmaking is more accomplished. Memories of Underdevelopment is based on a book and it shows - this is metaphor made literal, and at times Alea is able to turn the novel’s prose into cinematic poetry in ways so effective as to make the film’s lofty reputation fully justified. But other moments show the seams in this transition to screen - especially the rape subplot that works quite naturally in a metaphorical sense but requires on screen a straightforward rhythm that feels out of place and kills some of the film’s momentum. By the way, I know a fair amount about Cuban history (for an American anyway) and that helped to keep me engaged here. This may be tougher going for some, and I do recommend seeking context in order to fully appreciate what Alea is getting at.",1,4,0,101,692,29-May-18,rated-7

So much so, in fact, that those opposed to the revolution tend to call it amagnificent and unrepeatable fluke, produced as it was by a film institute that was virtually a Marxist ministry. Those in favour cherish it as a landmarkthat avoids almost all of the radical cliches. The director was Tomas Gutierrez Alea, a middle-class university-educated Cuban who went along with the revolution despite some of the doubts about emerging bureaucratisation displayed by the equally bourgeois protagonist of his film. This is Sergio, a wealthy man who decides to stay behind when his family leaves for the US. The time is 1961 and the film is placed between the exodus after the disastrous Bays of Pigs invasion and the missile crisis of the following year. The film centres on Sergio’s thoughts and experiences as he is confronted by the new reality. He is fundamentally an alienated outsider, scornful of his bourgeois family and friends but also of the naivety of those who believe that everything can suddenly be changed. He continues to live as a rent-collecting property owner and, in his private life, chases women with an almost neurotic fervour. He is, in fact, the sort of man with whom we can easily identify from our experience of European films and literature. The difference is that he is placed in exceptional circumstances and finds it difficult to understand them. Memories is one of the best films ever made about the sceptical individual’s place in the march of history. None of this would have been enough if Alea hadn’t constructed his film so richly, and in excitingly cinematic rather than literary terms. Documentary and semi-documentary footage is presented as Sergio would have seen it and the fictional story that goes along with it is very European in its narrative style. memories-002There are even clips from a porno film – there were many made in Cuba under Batista – and Alea himself and the author of the original novel comment on what is going on in Sergio’s mind. As one admiring critic has said, “the film insists that what we see is a function of how we believe, and that how we believe is what our history has made of us”. Memories was Alea’s fifth film, and probably his most famous, though at least three others received international attention. Death of a Bureaucrat was an ironic satire on the way revolutions stiffen into deadly bureaucracies; The Last Supper showed how the black slaves of Cuba in the plantation era were reconciled by religion to a life of bondage; and Strawberry and Chocolate was a brave and popular film that, despite Castro’s disdain for homosexuality, dared to have a stolid party cadre befriended and changed by a gay man. Alea was clearly no ordinary product of the revolutionary cinema. He died recently of cancer and was honoured by a government he often seemed to criticise – and even more by ordinary Cubans, who flocked to his films.",8,3,0,0,181,22/9/17,0

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World is astonishing and immersive. It far exceeded my expectations. I go bananas for meticulous world-building and period authenticity. This has both in spades. It's in the cookware, the language, the formality, and the mechanics of sailing. I love when a movie is so detailed that you find yourself accidentally learning.  The opening sequence is an absolute knockout. It starts at early morning with the crewmen hanging in hammocks as the camera creeps along the deck and the hull. We see livestock, cannons, lanterns, etc. The camera is rocking gently with the ocean. It's a flawless establishment of the world. Suddenly there's a fight with a French vessel and Peter Weir shows you that he's the fucking boss. You don't get many openings with this much gusto. It drops you in and you're holding on for dear life. About the time I thought this was going to take a Mutiny on the Bounty turn, Crowe demonstrates that he is a far greater leader than Bligh could ever be. There's something very special in Master and Commander that always manages to intercept the drama at just the right time: merriment. These guys know how to party after a hard day's work. The frigate life is some ruthless shit, but everyone manages to rise up and meet it with positivity. And they love a good fight. When the Acheron turns hard starboard to fire upon the HMS Surprise, these gentlemen are all smiles. I loved that. The special effects are pretty astonishing for 2003. I tried a few times to see how much was practical and how much was CGI but could rarely tell the difference. The combination of composite work, soundstage and on-location photography is seamless. This was only 14 years ago and it already fits into the category of ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""",4,8,7,187,556,3-Aug-17,rated-9

Breathtaking battle scenes are stages for personality and character development; elevating the numerous sailors we follow from mere swashbuckling types to complex, diversely driven souls all working in pursuit of something they see higher than themselves. At the center of this is Captain Aubrey (Crowe) and the ship's surgeon (Bettany). The film soars the highest when these two are simply conversing and playing the violin and cello in their quarters; discussing what it means to be a leader, the ethical limits of performing a duty, strategy as philosophy and vice versa. It's about the unnatural life a sailor leads. A thrilling, beautiful meditation on humanity's compulsion to dominate and need to reflect; to glimpse the underlying engines of creation both in naturalist discoveries on the Galapagos and in the sacrifices made on-board their ""little wooden worlds"". It's the rare action movie that rouses and compels through affirming life rather than glorifying it's destruction; as Weir perfectly crafts an epic without sacrificing character in the slightest.

It came out seventeen years ago and has the look of a state-of-the-art adventure produced with the best money can buy, and yet has the feel of something much older. War films haven’t exactly fallen out of fashion. “1917” came within an inch of winning the Best Picture Oscar earlier this year and performed admirably at the box office. But history on the seven seas hasn’t played much of a role in cinema lately. “Pirates of the Caribbean” is too squarely in the fantasy genre to count. “Greyhound” was quietly dropped on Apple TV without the fanfare that would befit a Tom Hanks vehicle. As for “Midway”, I have been told the less is said about that one, the better. This is, coincidentally, already the fourth Peter Weir film I have seen this year. His range is truly astounding, stretching from unorthodox English teacher Robin Williams inspiring his students to become free thinkers, over Jim Carrey discovering that his entire life has been a staged television show to Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weaver falling in love in a country on the brink of civil war. I watched this one once a few years back already, but was thoroughly impressed by how well it held up. It had the colossal misfortune of sharing a release year with “Lord of the Rings: Return of the King”, or it undoubtedly would have swept the technical categories at the Oscars. This is a gorgeous visual achievement, a gritty depiction of everyday life for sailors on a warship in the early 1800s, when the English and French were battling for control over the oceans. There are several scenes of destructive chaos, especially when they are navigating around Cape Horn, and Weir perfectly captures the panic boiling over when the most powerful forces of nature are unleashed upon them. The script does occasionally lose itself in nautical lingo, but for the most part there is a much-appreciated clarity to the orders being shouted across the deck.   Jack Aubrey, captain of the H.M.S. Surprise, is not a tyrant. He appreciates creative thinking among his crew and rewards initiative. But he is also determined and a disciplinarian. He doesn’t take well to criticism or insubordination. The only one with permission offer his opinion candidly is the ship’s physician Dr. Stephen Maturin, who technically doesn’t have a place in the hierarchy on board and is unlikely to have ulterior motives for speaking his mind. Aubrey does share some less desirable qualities with two of the most notorious literary captains in history, Ahab and Bligh, even if his vices aren’t as pronounced. His judgement becomes clouded as he spends week after week hunting down the French privateer Acheron, which takes him far outside of his designated area of operation. But eventually the safety of the crew no longer comes first, and his wounded personal pride takes priority instead. And as his ruthless pursuit antagonizes his men, he increasingly resorts to tougher measures to maintain order. Aubrey is not an unlikable guy, and Russell Crowe is the perfect actor to play someone who never entirely loses his humanity in even the direst of circumstances. But it becomes increasingly difficult to side with him the longer the pursuit goes on.   Some of the conflicts on board felt a little forced. Aubrey orders corporeal punishment for neglecting to salute an officer, but seems to forget to reprimand another guy for shooting the physician on board in his eagerness to fire his rifle at an albatross. There is a fun little twist at the end that somewhat falls apart when you think about the serious lack of communication that would have had to have taken place for Aubrey not to catch on sooner. But I appreciated the emphasis on the characters, rather than the chase. The script makes time to check in on minor players, including Lord Blakeney, a young chap who loses his arm in the first clash with the Acheron. It’s hard to stomach how young some of these guys were when they were pulled into the Royal Navy and asked to do their duty for their country. There is also Midshipman Hollom, an officer who is increasingly blamed for a string of misfortunes out of anyone’s hands but God’s. It’s a particularly crushing episode that shows that even a captain as well liked as Lucky Jack is unable to stamp out suspicion and paranoia on board. “Master and Commander” doesn’t romanticize life on open water in times of war. While it does occasionally offer some lighthearted moments of Aubrey and Maturin playing music together or the doctor gushing over the flora and fauna of the Galapagos Islands, it never lets us forget that it’s a perilous existence and that far too often a Bible had to be opened to eulogize those left behind in the depths of the ocean for eternity.",4,13,0,522,496,11-Aug-20,rated-9

Adapted from a couple of novels from Patrick O'Brian's 20 volume Aubrey-Maturin series, it manages to capture the sense of adventure and historical allusion really well. I have read a fair few of these novels and they all share a common trait and that is deep characterization, historical accuracy and spectacle.  The latter of those is often easily transferred to film, the first two not so much. Leave it to Weir, who averages about 1 film every two years, to not only capture the characters but also submerge us in a richly detailed historical setting that feels refreshingly authentic. Granted he perhaps focusses a bit too much on the characters which does a small disservice to the pacing of the film, but it also adds a nice, rich nuance that is often missed in films like these. I am not a fan of Crowe, but this is a role he plays best. Commanding, manly and determined, he displays a natural authority which makes him very convincing as a leader. Paul Bettany offers up a nice counterbalance with his ship's surgeon and the complex friendship they have thus becomes believable, a key aspect to this film, much like it was in the novels. There is, naturally, a lot of action as well. The naval battles are absolutely stunning and Weir proves that he has a great sense of dimension and treats his audiences to action that is actually easy to follow without losing any tension.  But the true strength of the film lies in how life aboard the Surprise is portrayed. It is scrumptiously rich in detail, never shying away from showing the small day to day things and also revealing some intriguing rules and rites in a place that in itself is a unique society.  For me this is one of the best, modern examples of a classic adventure film, with its heart in the right place and its brain switched on.",7,164,22,114,"18,826",18-Oct-12,rated-8

Russell Crowe stars as Captain Aubrey of the HMS Surprise as they hunt for a French warship in the southern Atlantic, and Paul Bettany as the ship's doctor, Dr. Stephen Maturin, the nominal moral compass and aide to the stubborn captain. It's a staunchly naval affair and features a wide variety of what it meant to be a sailor on a naval warship in the Napoleonic times, from the ugly to the spectacular. It's an adventure and action marvel of a film and Peter Weir sucks you into his 19th century world with ease in what is a refreshingly enjoyable adventure flick. Perhaps a bit crude of me, but I feel compelled to temporarily compare Master and Commander to Pirates of the Caribbean. This film seems to lack all of the simplicity of the latter pirates franchise, but revels itself in all of the nuances and complexities of naval warfare. Master and Commander is a gorgeous undertaking when it comes to showcasing naval warfare; the exchanges of firepower and broadsides and cannon fire at sea here are wondrous and breathtaking to say the least. And it's all done, for the most part, in great detail where we see all the effort, toil and sweat, coordination and difficulty that it took to execute a combat engagement. Even the regular sea voyage, from sailing to regular life on the vessel is fascinating. We get to be with the Captain and his officers, with the regular sailors, and everyone in between so we can experience the life aboard the HMS Surprise.  In many ways the film also doesn't let the adventure, action and spectacle eclipse itself either, and the film in many ways a meditation on character. Our two central characters, Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin, become canvases so to speak upon which we get to explore what it means to be obsessed, to do your 'duty', and so on. Captain Aubrey is a skilled naval captain and his men admire and revere him as such, but when he's pitted against a more advanced and superior opponent, he doesn't back down in a (in the eyes of his crew) almost suicidal determination to defeat his adversary. We explore the stubbornness, pride, and ego that drives Aubrey and how he evolves throughout the film to adapt to his newfound challenges. Doctor Maturin, meanwhile, is the moral compass to Aubrey and tries to advise him, representing compromise as a virtue. The back and forth between these two characters is fascinating and Paul Bettany to say the least is a great actor and elevates the character in every way. In some of it's faults, I would perhaps criticise the film's climactic battle despite all of the joy and fun that it was. The naval gunfire was amazing and fun to watch, but I felt that the camera work and film editing became borderline incomprehensible and impossible to follow once hand-to-hand fighting began. Perhaps it was to show the confusion and chaos of ship-to-ship fighting, but it was hard to follow and I wasn't a fan of the ""shaky cam"" technique here, muddying up what was built up to be the film's best scene. There is also a slight uneven attention paid to the characters; there's a character name Hollom who is important in the opening scene, he disappears, and then reappears to be of great importance and it was jarring for the movie to make me care about him and his plights so suddenly.  Otherwise, it's hard to nitpick and harp on what is an undeniably beautifully shot, masterfully produced, and superbly directed and acted film. Master and Commander is a one in a haystack sort of film in regards to it's subject matter, and it excels as a Napoleonic epic. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.",5,10,0,95,513,4-Sep-17,rated-8

Notably, this film is not incredibly fun, nor is it highly entertaining or rewatchable, or even memorable. In fact, this at least my third viewing (more likely my fourth or fifth), and I found myself constantly surprised by the plot. I truly did not remember much of the film. Little pieces, here and there, yes- the insect pun, for example- but the larger plot was entirely absent from my mind. This is rare for me, and probably my largest strike against Master and Commander.  Despite this, I give it a nearly perfect rating. Why? Because there aren't enough films like it. Because what it tries to do, it achieves so flawlessly that it doesn't even matter that I can hardly remember the plot six months later. Because it is one of the few movie experiences that you can really just lose yourself in.  Perhaps I'm biased. Perhaps I just love the setting- something about naval warfare, the methodology, the slow pace of it, really appeals to me. But even taking that into account, Master and Commander is a remarkable film. It's not terribly long, yet feels longer than it is- a fast paced first act is followed by a glacial second act, where we get character and world development. This world development is the crowning achievement this film has to offer. There is so much going on in the world of the ship that at times it hardly feels like a movie. There are so many tiny nuances - extremely minor characters feel alive (the grumpy Kellick, the old man with tattooed hands, even Billy Boyd's character), the claustrophobic confines of the ship feel real. Like I said above, the film is, above all else, immersive.  Towards the end of the film, Crowe's character - Aubrey - promotes one of his men. This is almost entirely inconsequential to the narrative of the film. This man, while certainly not a minor character, scarcely receives any real character development, and just thirty minutes after finishing the film, I'm hard pressed to remember his name. And yet, the inclusion of this promotion is absolutely essential, and while watching the film, I was very happy for this anonymous newly-promoted Captain. Why? Because the film draws you in; the film makes you a crew member. It doesn't bother spending time explaining the little details; rather, it throws a million at you at once and lets you soak it all in. It may not be the best way to make a blockbuster film, but it makes it an experience like few others.  Writing this, I feel it is one of my poorer reviews. I read back over these words, and I'm not happy with them. Yet I'll leave them as they are, because I cannot possibly hope to put into words what this film accomplishes in my mind. But if you take anything away from this review, know that Master and Commander is well worth your time as an incredibly well made cinematic experience.",6,10,0,483,445,8-Aug-14,rated-9

Thought provoking themes, very impressive attention to detail, and cathartic action sequences. The themes are very cleverly interwoven in practically every subject on screen, from naturalism to naval warfare. Often when I’m watching a movie, I can’t help but think just how difficult it was to do certain things, I had this experience multiple times during my viewing. For instance, I can only imagine how much of a bitch research was for this movie. I’d imagine I’d be constantly frustrated if I were making this movie. Doing research about boats and this time period could not be anymore boring.While some of the action scenes (mostly the last ones) were a little choppy, there were some of them that were genuinely very thrilling and almost jaw-dropping.

Even though this film was recognized at the oscars it is still easily the most underrated film I’ve ever seen. If it would’ve made money at the box office then we would’ve seen 2 more of these since the plot is based off of 3 novels but unfortunately in the 2000’s this kind of story didn’t catch the modern day audiences which is a unforgiving travesty considering the film is one-of-a-kind Hollywood blockbuster with a gigantic budget behind it.  Russell Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey gives his best performance of his career from what I’ve seen, and yes I’ve seen him in Gladiator. Russell performs his character in such a charismatic way that it’s impossible to not love his character. He’s also disciplined and very traditional. He’s friendly but will punish a crew member when they are out of line. Everyone loves lucky Jack because the captain is always thinking 2 steps ahead of his enemy.  Paul Bettany as Dr. Stephen is just as good as Crowe with his role. He’s the ships surgeon and the captains best friend. He’s the only one who can question Jack’s motives or decisions since their friendship is more important than the code of law. Paul’s character is intellectually driven by nature. He’s also nice and soft spoken to the crew members so that they can trust him while he cuts their arm off. (He does that) Dr. Stephen is just as likable and talented as Captain Jack. Seeing the two work together and learn off each other’s intelligence to capture their enemy is the core of this movie. This is honestly the best “buddy” combination I ever witnessed.  The cinematography is flawless. The sea has never looked more dangerous and beautiful. When the crew arrives on a island there is shots that take my breath away for how ethereal the mountains and sea looks. The production is phenomenal. The HMS Surprise looks and feels authentic, with the help of some fantastic sound design and camera work. Inside the ship you can hear the floor and wall cracks popping and waves slightly crashing against the outside, the camera slowly motioning with the sea makes you feel aboard with the crew. The directing from Peter Weir accurately gives you a in-depth view for what life is like on navel ship being a seaman, by their lingo, what they eat, how they act, their traditions, the tall tales being at sea, the film is filled with history that I absolutely adore. The classical score is just another piece of culture that’s added on to the elegant feel of this. Along with some epic action war scenes that isn’t dumbed down for simple minded pleasures. The humor is very clever and not forced. The character Killick has me bursting laughing each time.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I love this movie obviously. I’m surprised and disappointed this isn’t on any Letterboxd list or lists out there because it’s deserving of everyone’s praise and attention. They don’t make movies like this anymore, it’s a modern masterpiece in my eyes. Shame it didn’t get the recognition it deserved from the average movie goers. “Now tell me that wasn’t fun.”",6,39,2,92,886,17-May-20,rated-9

The first thing that jumps out to me is the cinematography, which is truly stunning. There are some mind-blowing shots and it isn't surprising that this won the Academy Award for both it's cinematography and sound design (which, of course, was also excellent). In fact, this film feels really authentic as a whole. Like, there aren't really many ""Hollywood-ised"" moments. Maybe a couple of the action sequences but even they feel authentic, relatively speaking. The performances of the actors here also lent to that. Crowe is great in the lead and the support cast are all solid, with Paul Bettany being an obvious standout.  I guess my biggest issue with this, and it comes down to a purely subjective thing, is that this subject doesn't interest me a whole lot. You'd think it would as I love pirates but I guess that's their ""cool"" and rebellious nature that does that for me. I would even go as far as saying the authenticity hurt the film's overall enjoyment for me as it is very slow in places and the subject matter being covered in those times didn't tickle my pickle at all. A more Hollywood version of this (ala Pirates of the Caribbean) would be more up my alley. Overall, this is very well-made; I can't really fault it on a technical level.

I don’t know how often I saw it, maybe between ten and twenty times and I can’t have enough. The story about a Captain and his Doctor friend. During the Napoleon Wars, they chasing a French warship through the Atlantic and Pacific.  I am a huge fan of the Aubrey-Maturin-Series from author Patrick O‘Brian, had read 7 novels so far.  And Director Peter Weir understands it, to catch the atmosphere out of the books and puts them into perfect pictures. The special effects are well dosed and the rest are real ships in real water, what a tremendous art direction. The cinematography and sound effects had won the Oscars back in 2003, despite the big competitor „The Lord of the Rings 3“, absolut justifiably. Through out the whole film you got the feeling to be on board of the „H.M.S. Surprise“. The movie is a mix from the 7th and 8th novel and in my opinion it is on of the best book adaptations of all time. The casting is  really strong, from the statists to the supporting actors, but the real highlight of the film are the leading actors, Russel Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey and Paul Battany as Stephen Maturin, they perfectly bring the heroes of the same name series to life. Everytime I read a Book from this Series I only can imagine them both in that roles, no one else. Since a few years there are rumors about a sequel, or prequel to Master and Commander, the Studios didn’t wanted to spend the money because of the box office, but maybe streaming channels like Netflix will fulfill my hopes and dreams for a Sequel to this wonderful Masterpiece.

Peter Weir does a commendable job at immersing the viewer into the world of early nineteenth-century seafaring. The only other maritime-flavored work I can recall that devotes this much effort into achieving a high degree of realism is the first season of the show The Terror. Of course, what is a ship without a crew. Actually, the cast is the least interesting aspect since most of them are cookie-cutter HMS types. Nobody sticks out, bar the captain and the doctor.

There's at least four films that I know of released in the same year of 2003 that had a sea-setting that I could have used for this task. We were given the highly energetic Pirates of the Caribbean, the adventurous emotional romp Finding Nemo, and the extremely underrated and little-known DreamWorks film known as Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas. Master and Commander on the other hand, tries to be different from the latter three in that it's attempting to go the grittier route on the high seas to appeal to the Oscar crowd. And it fails. Yep. I said it. I know it's an acclaimed masterpiece, but this stinker failed. To all the aspiring filmmakers reading this review, what do you look for when experiencing a great movie? It's a simple answer; story and characters, visuals and technicalities last. I'm sorry to disappoint the fans, but while it had a convincing story, there was hardly any backup on character motivations to make the plot plausible. Like I said, the plotline's promising; it involves the British Navy on an adventure to defeat a French ship that nearly annihilated them during the Napoleonic Wars, but I'm sorry, I did not feel a connection for any of these characters. There's no motivations except maybe defeat Napoleon (but that's obvious), and with the exception of Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany in the lead roles, I could have sworn I was watching a lifeless History Channel minimovie. The only I emotion I felt when viewing this was a scene in the beginning where after the ambush, a kid had to get his arm amputated; his acting had prime guts in handling the horrendous pain; other than that, it's a bore. So boring than I fell asleep during the multiple pointless political banters when there should have been more heated conflict and I swear that the filmmakers deliberately staged a kid committing suicide out of nowhere in one scene just to fully wake the audience up. Pacing is atrocious; I understand making this feel like real time, but seriously, deliberately adding to the already lengthy runtime by adding a scene where Paul Bettany is accidentally shot and shots of sea animals that are better placed on the Disneynature movies does not make your Oscar-nominated movie more dramatic; it instead tortures me even more that the film is a lot longer and more slower. But I will say this; the cinematography and atmosphere are beautifully shot, the action, with the exception of its clunky finale, is highly intense, the musical arrangements are superb, the ending is brilliant in the fact that it... just ends, and despite the weak characters, Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany did their best in a mundane situation, but decent technicalities does not save the film from its tortuously slow pacing, its poor attempt using simply a historic event to justify poor characterization when obviously much more initiative should have been taken to make this work, making me feel all the more gipped that I had this film in my DVD collection for so... so long. You know what filmmakers, though your competing sea adventure defies physics like a majority of action-oriented films do, give me Pirates of the Caribbean over this boring, pathetic waste.

I do think that Russell Crowe did a good job as the lead, but I didn't care about his character. I understand that this movie is more focused on the situation that the characters are dealing with rather than the characters themselves but it would have been nice to get to know more about them. The acting and script are consistent. Not great, not bad, just average. What sets this movie apart is its visuals and production, both of which are unbelievably amazing. They really help get you invested in the movie. They take you into the early 1800s and make you feel like you are on that boat. Even though there weren't that many, the action sequences were incredible. Both thrilling and entertaining. The overall pacing was pretty good even if I was not always completely into it. The style, cinematography, and direction really exceeded my expectations. I was thoroughly impressed by these three elements and never forgot just how strong they were. For the most part, this movie is dumb fun. The only thing that separates this movie from other ""dumb fun"" movies is the direction and technicals that heavily improve the experience.

The most interesting of these subplots involves the doctor played by Paul Bettany and his honestly very adorable quest to study the animals of the Galápagos Islands. He was by far the most interesting character and his scenes with Russel Crowe are some of he best in the movie. Technically though, the movie is really great. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is amazing and the sound of the battleships is powerful. The editing can make the climax a bit hard to follow, but does a good job for most of the movie to make sure it doesn't drag too much. Despite its problems, I found this movie to be quite impressive in its scale and it's definitely worth watching.",5,22,0,"1,603","1,037",9-Jul-20,rated-7

An $150 million game of nautical cat-and-mouse, this movie is one that seems impossible to emerge from Hollywood today. In a bold choice for a period epic, Master & Commander sustains a small scope throughout. We never leave this particular mission, there are no flashbacks, no subplots involving families and intrigue back home, not even diversions to the enemy ship. In fact, the movie starts in the midst of the ongoing hunt between French vessel Acheron and Captain Aubrey’s outmanned outgunned HMS Surprise. Commence two hours of naval tactics, crew camaraderie and hardships, and slice-of-life details aboard an English warship circa 1800s. The cast is strong all-around, with the friendship between Russell Crowe’s Aubrey and Bettany’s Dr. Maturin acting as the film’s thematic engine. Glory, honor, the challenges of command and difficulties of leadership, coming of age: all topics explored amid raging storms, ship upkeep, moments of calm, and thundering long guns. Interestingly, the crew of the Surprise never descends into mutiny or disorder as in so many similar films. It was honestly quite refreshing to see a naval crew operating with a sense of bond and brotherhood; even from our short time with the ship, there is a tangible sense of adventures past and trust forged. Having just rewatched Curse of the Black Pearl (also 2003!), the battles in this were absolutely fascinating by comparison, raw and nuanced versus the breezy spectacle of the Pirates films. These were the most intense, gorgeous, and grounded naval battles I’ve ever seen: part last-man-standing slaughter of hacking blades and point-blank cannons, part technical maneuvering and teamwork under pressure. The visceral thrill of pounding cannon fire and splintering hulls was expected, the intelligent strategies and clever deceptions were not.  Never thought I’d discover a movie that challenges Apocalypto, but Master & Commander does just that: the lavish detail and scale of a historical epic acting as a canvas for the focused pace of a chase film.",4,17,1,853,753,19-Jan-20,rated-9

But it surprised me in many ways. Mostly, its maturity and quietness. There’re fewer naval battles than I expected and more time getting to know the crew and the period details of life on the ship. The sound design is masterful. The score only comes in at key moments, so you’re mostly hearing the waves crack and the ship’s creaks. Visually, the staging and cinematography make you feel like you’re on the ship. I was especially impressed by the ever-present maze of ropes. In one scene, the camera weaves around and between the ropes as it follows two characters’ pursuit of a bird flying around the ship. Top notch staging. And then there’s the episodic nature of the plot—another thing that surprised me. Time is taken for little moments like the crew singing, the captain & doctor playing music together, a boy learning firsthand stories of his hero. Even scientific exploration of island animal life.  Captain Aubrey at one point calls the ship “this wooden world,” and in an impassioned speech says “this ship is our home. This ship is England.” Master and Commander treats that idea—that all the world can be contained on a naval ship—as its guiding principle.",6,25,2,259,317,8-May-20,rated-9

Looking back, I'm gonna plant my flag and declare Russell Crowe to have been pretty much the greatest pure movie star in Hollywood from roughly 1997–2003. (Those who love Cinderella Man more than I do can extend this to 2005 if they like.) Not that every one of his performances during that period was great, necessarily—I for one have seen neither Mystery, Alaska nor Proof of Life—but watching him again here reminded me how quietly, effortlessly dynamic he was at his peak. The movie's a tad anecdotal, perhaps (which is what happens when you cherry-pick from an entire series of novels) but there's not a single unmemorable scene (that happens too!), and the supporting cast is surprisingly vivid considering that none of those young actors has made any significant subsequent impression. Just a rousing good time; that we got no more of these but the compleat Harry Potter, Hunger Games and Twilight (with a book split into two movies in each case) feels like a deliberate nose-thumbing from adolescent dominion. Here's my 2003 review for Time Out New York: __________________________________________________________ Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World features what may well be the worst joke I've ever heard—a joke so resoundingly awful that it was only when the punch line was deployed that I realized I'd encountered a version of it before, long ago (it may have been on a Dixie cup), and had deliberately repressed all memory of it. Jack Aubrey (Russell Crowe), the stalwart, driven captain of the HMS Surprise, tells the groaner in question to the ship's doctor and part-time naturalist, Stephen Maturin (Paul Bettany), over supper one evening. The year is 1805: Napoleon is wreaking havoc across Europe, and the Surprise, one of the British Navy's finest, has been ordered to sink, capture or otherwise detain the progress of a French vessel, the Acheron, before it can reach the Pacific. Tensions run high; the sea is rough, unforgiving. At Aubrey's table, however, there's still time for low vaudeville. Even as you groan, you're thinking, I love this guy. I should confess that I haven't read Patrick O'Brian's popular series of historical novels, two of which form the basis of Peter Weir's pleasing film adaptation. (Hence the dual title.) Whether the onscreen Aubrey conforms to the spirit of his literary counterpart is a matter for others to decide, and I won't begrudge longtime fans any grumbling (hell, I'm still pissed off at Anthony Hopkins for turning the unfailingly urbane Hannibal Lecter into a hammy, slurp-slurping bogeyman). But it's hard to imagine anybody without a prior conception of the character failing to warm to Master and Commander's forthright yet waggish hero, who's as comfortable performing a duet for violin and cello (with Maturin taking the latter instrument) as he is scrambling up his ship's rigging. Crowe remains unparalleled among contemporary actors for his ability to invest relatively uncomplicated roles with old-fashioned Hollywood gravity and charisma, and here, as in A Beautiful Mind, he's given an ideal foil in the precise, angular Bettany, who plays Maturin with an appealing combination of earnestness and austerity. With companions as vivid and congenial as these, who needs swordplay? Don't worry, you get that as well. Indeed, Master and Commander's primary theme, occasionally overemphasized, is the conflict between warfare and naturalism—which is to say, between action and knowledge—and this dichotomy is reflected in the film's very structure, its deft tug-of-war between rousing nautical adventure and exacting historical inquisition. O'Brian's novels are renowned for their accuracy, and Weir, who has devoted much of his career to the delineation of isolated communities (the hippie dropouts of The Mosquito Coast, the manufactured town of Seahaven in The Truman Show), honors his source, devoting much of the movie's lengthy running time to the quotidian details of life aboard a 19th-century Navy warship. He makes a point of opening the movie with an impressionistic survey of the Surprise's interior at night, prowling beneath men swaying gently in hammocks; conditioned by thrillers, we expect the eerie stillness to be broken at any moment, but nothing happens until the following morning. And while the various battles are as exciting as they ought to be, the movie's highest drama is arguably reserved for the heartbreaking scene in which Aubrey reneges on a promise to let Maturin explore the Galápagos Islands, on which Charles Darwin had not yet set foot. (Fortunately for us—there is no more beautiful spot on the planet, and this is reportedly the first fiction feature to use it as a location—he gets his chance later.) Of course, one sure sign that a movie isn't working is that you walk away commenting on its remarkable production design. Master and Commander wears its scholarship lightly; the minutiae and dense jargon never threaten to overshadow the story or the characterizations. The average viewer, while admiring Aubrey's determination and courage, will surely identify with Maturin, a landlubber at heart, who at one point says with a dry smile, ""Clearly, something nautical and fascinating just happened. I'm at a loss.""",8,29,0,54,"16,710",29-Oct-20,rated-8

Here is one of the rare directors who was almost always given trust and control of his own vision for his films, even if it meant the end result would perhaps be prone to financial risk. He has traded in studio and high profile movies that rarely conformed to what was expected of them, thus making him about as close to a maverick as you will get in Hollywood circles. It also meant that he was always likely to trade in a financial flop from time to time - although it's not entirely clear why Master and Commander would have been such a case. I guess, Russell Crowe aside, it's a largely star-free cast - you probably are rarely relying on Paul Bettany's name to put bums on seats, whether you like him or not. So that certainly could have been a major factor. My immediate assumption is that the studio marketed it like a bunch of twats but then again, how easy is it to market a film like this in this day and age? It is 14 years old now but these sorts of films are not exactly ten a penny in this era and they don't really come with huge in-built audiences. I suspect that Weir probably didn't care that much and, judging by the picture he has made, it really is quite steadfast in its own beliefs and in largely refusing to bow to the history of the seafaring adventure. So there is precious little mutiny here nor much in-fighting between captain and underlings. Instead, and delightfully, it's a film where the crew's trust in Crowe rarely flags even when the fortunes of 'Lucky Jack' dry up for a while - almost literally. It's also a rare film of this kind that chooses to almost completely refuse to delve into the politics of 'recruitment' during the Napoleonic Wars, and is only briefly referred to by the 'anarchist' Bettany. One of the reasons I've always really liked Weir as a director is that he actually credits his audience with a lot of intelligence - rightly or wrongly! He doesn't feel the need to bother us with history lessons, assuming one or both of two things - that we already know what's going on behind this conflict and that we don't really need to know it anyway as it doesn't play a massive part in this film's story. He's also a director who can create utterly thrilling set-piece scenes. Rarely has the sheer close-quarters brutality of sea battles been so spectacularly portrayed as here. They really were the most amazing things - two ships just parking themselves next to each other and blasting the shit out of each other until one is left standing. The destructive shooting gallery nature of these conflicts is brought to life as vividly and as beautifully as you would expect from Weir. Crowe's charismatic display is exactly the kind of performance Weir has always preferred to build his films around, and he excels right up to the unexpectedly ambiguous ending. Add me to the list of people who will bemoan that we never got a franchise from this for years to come.",8,60,14,469,"10,150",5-Aug-17,rated-8

I don’t know how often I saw it, maybe between ten and twenty times and I can’t have enough. The story about a Captain and his Doctor friend. During the Napoleon Wars, they chasing a French warship through the Atlantic and Pacific.  I am a huge fan of the Aubrey-Maturin-Series from author Patrick O‘Brian, had read 7 novels so far.  And Director Peter Weir understands it, to catch the atmosphere out of the books and puts them into perfect pictures. The special effects are well dosed and the rest are real ships in real water, what a tremendous art direction. The cinematography and sound effects had won the Oscars back in 2003, despite the big competitor „The Lord of the Rings 3“, absolut justifiably. Through out the whole film you got the feeling to be on board of the „H.M.S. Surprise“. The movie is a mix from the 7th and 8th novel and in my opinion it is on of the best book adaptations of all time. The casting is  really strong, from the statists to the supporting actors, but the real highlight of the film are the leading actors, Russel Crowe as Captain Jack Aubrey and Paul Battany as Stephen Maturin, they perfectly bring the heroes of the same name series to life. Everytime I read a Book from this Series I only can imagine them both in that roles, no one else. Since a few years there are rumors about a sequel, or prequel to Master and Commander, the Studios didn’t wanted to spend the money because of the box office, but maybe streaming channels like Netflix will fulfill my hopes and dreams for a Sequel to this wonderful Masterpiece.

The script is written to an okay standard by Brock Yates as although there is a narrative occurring, it’s unfortunate because there are virtually no moments of humour to be had and it is the main reason as to why this movie doesn’t work.

I've recently embarked upon a self-imposed mission to watch Roger Moore films that aren't Bond films. As a part of the Failed Critics film review podcast I contribute to, we're having a ""Bond special"" when Skyfall comes out, and having drawn the ""Roger Moore"" straw, I realised that aside from mentioning a cameo in Spice World and his non-appearance on the first episode of Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge, I didn't really have a whole host of non-Bond related reference points! The second reason I watched this is for Burt Reynolds. I'm not explaining that further. The third reason is because it's one of those films that almost everybody I know saw as a kid and loved but I missed out on. I've been wary of these kind of films as inevitably they disappoint when watching them as an adult. I know that watching them now, as a grown adult (pffpffffpfffpfpff ""cannonBALL""!) means I'm not the target audience any more. The ship has sailed and I missed out. Tough titties. But, I thought I'd try it anyway. Who knows? Maybe some of the humour transcends age? And the result of my little test? It's silly, it's very broad in terms of the humour, it is essentially an episode of Wacky Races with less gadgets, real people and Penelope Pitstop getting her jugs out a bit more... but so what? I actually had a lot of fun watching this film! Moore actually does really well at parodying himself, ""celebrities"" and the Bond films. Almost to the point that I'm not sure how he managed to get away with it and then go back to doing Bond films..! Reynolds is hilarious too. Misogynistic at times but a man with that moustache ought to be really. If he wasn't womanising just a little bit, he wouldn't deserve to have that facial hair. Also, he earned this film a few extra laughs, but I won't talk about him as Burt doesn't like it when he's mentioned.",8,13,3,448,905,8-Oct-12,rated-7

It's also one of those 'classic' comedy films a lot of people remember fondly (as I did when first I watched it as a kid) but, truth be told, isn't really all that good; Hal Needham's all-star slapstick chase comedy relies almost entirely on the charm and reputations of the actors involved, not to mention a great deal of narrative repetition and on the vehicular element; the script barely exists and as a result, most of the characters barely do either. Crucially, the problem is this: for comedy it's just not very funny at all. The idea of the film gets lost very very quickly under the weight of who are involved; this is meant to be a knockabout chase comedy, in the vein of classic old-school Hollywood comedies perhaps such as It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, but there's barely any evidence of a chase within it. Needham almost entirely diverts what exists of a story into scene after scene just riffing off his actors, some of which I'm convinced weren't scripted at all - be it Burt Reynolds the impossibly cool and charming crafty driver, Roger Moore playing an eccentric Brit who believes he's a mixture of Roger Moore & James Bond, Dean Martin & Sammy Davis. Jr effectively playing themselves dressed up as two con-artist priests (and if Martin wasn't pissed as a skunk while he made this film, I'd be amazed) - I could go on. It's just structurally a mess - it has no structure, lurching simply from a series of gags and scenes without any cohesion, barely any of either hitting the mark. Farrah Fawcett is beautifully sweet and one scene with Dom DeLuise speaks to a better film; infact DeLuise and his daft alter-ego 'Captain Chaos' are easily the best thing in it and while Needham gives he & partner Reynolds plenty of screen time, he'll frequently cut to the Rat Pack boys or Moore embarrassing themselves, to Jamie Farr's shouty one-joke Sheik or Jackie Chan's horrifically stereotypical Japanese genius racer (even though Chan is Chinese, go figure). It ultimately just descends into a nonsensical punch up and the climax, by which point you'll have long switched off and started doing something else with the film on as background, like I did. Much as the sequel trotted out the same gags, they seemed to click better than those here - I actually wished I was watching it at various points. The sad thing is, there was a good film to be made here, but The Cannonball Run ultimately just feels like an in-joke we're not in on; a big Hollywood party they happened to put a few cameras in the middle of, letting beloved actors and stars riff on their own legend. At times, there's a charm about that but for an entire film, it just collapses very quickly under its own weight. If ever a movie deserved a remake that does the idea justice properly, this may well be it.",3,10,3,323,"2,103",17-Jun-12,rated-3

The more I see The Cannonball Run as an older, more discerning cinephile*, the less it feels like an actual movie and more just an abbreviated series of sketches held together by a barely there plot.  And while that's not necessarily bad, it does feel like it squanders its potential a little bit. The musical choices here are so strange.  It's basically three major pieces.  A (relatively straight-forward) opening song from Ray Stevens, a score composed mostly of Chuck Mangione's flugelhorn and an end theme, sung by a children's choir, about having dreams.  *This statement should not, in any way, be used to denote good taste on the author's part, nor any understanding of the fields of film theory, film structure or film history.",5,9,0,80,239,6-Jun-20,rated-7

The Cannonball Run is an experience in which you'll find yourself giggling at the sheer absurdity of the situations these characters get into. The humour doesn't always land, some jokes are either dated or come off as creepy from a modern context but shrug those off and there's still plenty to like. Unlike the sequel that gets bogged down in extraneous subplots, The Cannonball Run sticks to the race and is overall more cohesive as a film. Story wise the only complaints are that it takes a little bit too long getting the race going and there may be a few too many races for the plotline to handle - a few get very little screentime and are of no consequence to the proceedings at all.

Dean Martin -- He's the only son-of-a-bitch who looks like he knows he's in a shit movie... and decides to just have fun with it.

Finally found a copy of the movie today and it was enjoyable. I only paid $4 for the DVD and I'd say I got a good bargain. A great cast leads a story of a cross country road race where we see everyone from Burt Reynolds to Roger Moore trying to shake the cops and get to California first. Roger Moore was by far my favorite character to watch. They played him for some great laughs and moments only slightly more ridiculous than in his Bond movies. I particularly enjoyed the moment when the Aston Martin changed its license plates ala Goldfinger to trick the authorities. It was so cool to see Moore driving the DB-5 considering he never did in his Bond movies. The rest of the cast was enjoyable. Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr, and Jackie Chan also had standout moments. My main complaint was the fact that the race itself didn't make up as much of the movie. I would've liked to have seen more shenanigans on the highway instead of so much setup before the race started. A comedy I'm glad I own, The Cannonball Run isn't anything too stellar, but it sure was fun to watch. Anybody else want to see a remake where everybody is driving some famous movie car?

McClure, a kidnapper of adult women and a master of smarmy creepism. Dom DeLuise stars as Victor, an affable dude who dose terrible cosplay. Dean Martin stars as a drunk priest. Sammy Davis Jr. stars as a drunk, gambling priest. Farrah Fawcett stars as Pamela, a women who is totally fine telling people she doesn’t wear underwear. Roger Moore stars as himself. And Adrienne Barbeau’s cleavage stars as the boobs who gave 6-year old me his first TV crush.  A bunch of colorful car drivers compete against each other in a cross-country vehicle race. Among the competitors is a little Subaru stealth car driven by Jackie Chan (who at this point in his career was just a yellow belt who was bad at kicks). There’s a pair of dudes on a motorcycle that pops a wheelie the entire race because the man on the back seat is too fat. Jamie Farr plays an Arabian sheik who pays a teenage carhop to have her vagina medically washed so she can later join his harem. Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. basically play themselves, hanging off each other in every scene, obviously in love, usually with a drink in one hand and an eyeful of lady ass. It’s all pretty good fun as long as you don’t focus too much on the fact that everybody speeds, which is against the law in real life. There’s a doctor who does a great Trump face. Every time there’s a new scene with Roger Moore driving his European spy car, a different foxy lady is in the passenger seat. There is no movie-logic to this; they simply appear. Where is he finding these gorgeous women, wearing evening gowns and looking stunning, while driving the back highways of middle America? Kind of funny. There are some cool car stunts, but nothing too outrageous. The fight at the end between the Cannonballers and a gang of bikers is fun even though in reality the bikers would have annihilated the racers with guns and brutalism.

Over the holidays I got on this kick about watching all the movies Burt Reynolds made in the '70s and '80s with stuntman turned director Hal Needham, with 1981's The Cannonball Run I believe being the last of them. (UPDATE: Nope, still have Stroker Ace to go.) But while my middle-aged viewings of Smokey and the Bandit and Hooper made it clear that, decades later, these films not only still hold up, but with the passage of time have actually become more charming and brilliant than they were when they first came out, unfortunately the same cannot be said of Cannonball, a film that trades the laid-back fun of Needham's early work for a high concept that was already dead on arrival even 38 years ago when it first came out. That high concept was to essentially duplicate the ""every role is played by a star"" paradigm of such '60s films as It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World, but while using the template of '70s disaster films by filling all those roles with B-level has-beens and Hollywood fringe character actors; the movie stars such dubious celebrities as Dom DeLuise, Farrah Fawcett, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., the bug-eyed Jack Elam, Adrienne Barbeau, Terry Bradshaw (at the time just starting his transition from football player to media personality), Burt Convy, Jamie Farr, a pre-comeback Peter Fonda (here embarrassingly playing the ""tough"" leader of a biker gang, in what will go down in history as the laziest reference to Easy Rider ever made), and Jackie Chan in his American film debut (in which he doesn't speak a word of English, his job here being to embody every single racist stereotype about the Japanese we had in the early '80s). In fact, about the only person in this film besides Reynolds who had any kind of legitimate current cultural cache was Roger Moore (who at the time was in the middle of his run as James Bond), which explains why Moore got second-billing in the credits above everyone besides Reynolds himself. Interestingly, the conceit that brings them together is actually not that bad -- a famous underground coast-to-coast car race, based on a real-life one with the same name that was held five times in the '70s -- and if Needham had infused this with the same character-driven heart and gentle humor of, say, Hooper (a movie about the dangerous hijinx that stuntmen do off-set to amuse each other), he would've had the same enduring hit that still plays well in the 2010s, almost half a century later. But instead, Needham and company really lean in to the cheese here, letting terrible jokes and a #MeToo nightmare of easy prejudice stand in for the hard work of his better films; and while it paid off for all involved at the time (it was the 6th highest grossing movie of 1981, and eventually spawned two sequels that were hits themselves), it's an understatement to say that time has not been kind to it, a cringe-worthy disaster that nearly single-handedly kills all the goodwill Reynolds and Needham had built up with their earlier '70s good-ol-boy winners. I'm giving the movie 3 stars anyway, but 2 of those stars are simply for nostalgia alone -- this was one of the movies that played endlessly on cable during my own early-'80s coming-of-age years, and I was shocked to discover that I could still recite some of the dialogue by heart almost 40 years later. For those who aren't tied to this era by such nostalgia, however, do yourself a favor and skip right over this one altogether, and go straight to the surprisingly still relevant Smokey and the Bandit and Hooper.

Okay, so the semi-autobiographical Hooper (1978) wasn't too bad.  However, Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) wallowed in embarrassing comedy and brazen ego-massage for most of its runtime.  Sadly, The Cannonball Run is even worse. It barely even qualifies as a movie; it's more like a near-plotless glorified variety show littered with spectacular but narratively purposeless stunts, unbelievably lame (and often casually racist) attempts at humour and a whole slew of lazy star appearances. Burt Reynolds pretty much wheels out his Bandit act one more time for the kiddies.  Dom DeLuise plays his sidekick who also has a superhero alter-ego fit only for a pantomime.  Roger Moore plays himself while also sending up his role as 007.  Rat Packers Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. dress up as priests for some reason.  Jackie Chan is largely wasted as a Japanese driver and only gets to use his trademark martial arts during one scene.  Farrah Fawcett has even less to do as a tree lover who becomes Burt's love interest.  Jack Elam pulls silly faces as a deranged doctor named Van Helsing.  Peter Fonda pops up near the end as the leader of a biker gang because, you know, he was a biker in The Wild Angels and Easy Rider.

It's also one of those 'classic' comedy films a lot of people remember fondly (as I did when first I watched it as a kid) but, truth be told, isn't really all that good; Hal Needham's all-star slapstick chase comedy relies almost entirely on the charm and reputations of the actors involved, not to mention a great deal of narrative repetition and on the vehicular element; the script barely exists and as a result, most of the characters barely do either. Crucially, the problem is this: for comedy it's just not very funny at all. The idea of the film gets lost very very quickly under the weight of who are involved; this is meant to be a knockabout chase comedy, in the vein of classic old-school Hollywood comedies perhaps such as It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World, but there's barely any evidence of a chase within it. Needham almost entirely diverts what exists of a story into scene after scene just riffing off his actors, some of which I'm convinced weren't scripted at all - be it Burt Reynolds the impossibly cool and charming crafty driver, Roger Moore playing an eccentric Brit who believes he's a mixture of Roger Moore & James Bond, Dean Martin & Sammy Davis. Jr effectively playing themselves dressed up as two con-artist priests (and if Martin wasn't pissed as a skunk while he made this film, I'd be amazed) - I could go on. It's just structurally a mess - it has no structure, lurching simply from a series of gags and scenes without any cohesion, barely any of either hitting the mark. Farrah Fawcett is beautifully sweet and one scene with Dom DeLuise speaks to a better film; infact DeLuise and his daft alter-ego 'Captain Chaos' are easily the best thing in it and while Needham gives he & partner Reynolds plenty of screen time, he'll frequently cut to the Rat Pack boys or Moore embarrassing themselves, to Jamie Farr's shouty one-joke Sheik or Jackie Chan's horrifically stereotypical Japanese genius racer (even though Chan is Chinese, go figure). It ultimately just descends into a nonsensical punch up and the climax, by which point you'll have long switched off and started doing something else with the film on as background, like I did. Much as the sequel trotted out the same gags, they seemed to click better than those here - I actually wished I was watching it at various points. The sad thing is, there was a good film to be made here, but The Cannonball Run ultimately just feels like an in-joke we're not in on; a big Hollywood party they happened to put a few cameras in the middle of, letting beloved actors and stars riff on their own legend. At times, there's a charm about that but for an entire film, it just collapses very quickly under its own weight.

Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game is complete chaos, but it is controlled chaos, a mess so saturated with meaning that it will take me several viewings to attempt to fully understand all the nuances in the film. Nearly every character in the film is vain and self-absorbed, and they all carry a sense of entitlement that allows them to play mercilessly with others' feelings. The few people who aren't part of the spoiled bourgeoisie - the idiotic aviator who's in love with a married aristocrat, the trigger-happy groundskeeper, and Octave with his forced joviality -  are nevertheless often unlikable, if only because their sincerity is wasted in a world that scoffs upon such naivete. The plot unfolds in a manner so spontaneous that it actually seems as though it all happens while the camera records the events. Perhaps that's because the camera weaves through so many characters' lives so gracefully, and because each character is played with utter conviction by the excellent ensemble cast. And of course it's because Jean Renoir allows his characters to take center stage, so that we notice directorial tricks only upon close observation, and not at all when we're fully absorbed in the film. The Rules of the Game is so well plotted that each instance of foreshadowing hints at something that viewers can never quite guess at. And yet, when each plot thread unfolds, our minds immediately leap back to that first instance of incongruity. Take the strange intimacy between Catherine and Octave (played wonderfully by Renoir himself). There is a moment early on in the film when they both sink into bed, laughing and talking with the intimacy of lovers. But they're not lovers, one detail that is absolutely clear from the get-go. This puzzling, throwaway instance sets up the entire third act of the film. And then there's the much-lauded hunting sequence, in which we watch real rabbits and birds being slaughtered by the gun-toting bourgeoisie. It's painful to watch not only because it's obvious that real animals were being killed, but because it later takes on even more significance when a character later undergoes the same fate as the animals. It's incredible, then, that a plot so complex and intricately layered unfolds with such spontaneity onscreen. The story is hilarious one minute, and a frothy brand of tragic the next minute. We despise all the characters, but we want to find out what happens to them. The Rules of the Game takes place in a world where nobody is happily married or happy indulging in an affair, perhaps because nobody in the film seems to believe in love.  Love, as it exists in society, is merely the mingling of two whims and the contact of two skins. They take lovers because it's all a lark, but when things do get serious toward the end, an inevitable tragedy takes place. And perhaps that is the most important rule of this game: it's all fun and games until you become foolish enough to actually fall in love.",12,61,7,68,"3,007",6-May-14,rated-9

In my previous review of Citizen Kane i mentioned the on-going debate between which films deserve the greatest film title, and while Citizen Kane is on my top favorites list taking the first spot, i would still repeat my claim that this is the best film ever made. Along with Orson Welles's and Alfred Hitchcock's entire filmographies respectively, this is the cream of cinema. Never have i seen such a beautiful film also having a strong social commentary, especially regarding the aristocracy. If i am correct, historically the aristocrat class died out by the end of the 19th century. Even here in Croatia i read book accounts on how the noble class started to fade away, and the course of history in the 20th century taking a path of its own. And just take a look at the poster for the film it looks so beautiful, i sometimes see a resemblance to myself in some poster with my own photo, because you clearly see the guy on the right wearing a black suit, but i also saw that in the Matrix poster with Reeves dressed in black as well. :) Anyways, the cinematography in this film is untouched by anything that came before or after it.

It operates by embodying specific and different aspects to enhance and deepen the narrative with their juxtaposition as it follows various members of upper-class French society together with their servants just before the beginning of WWII and excavates empathy and humour in their many absurdities; however, it's not an isolated component which makes this a great film, but rather their aggregation. It beautifully summons and apprehends many moments of satire and drama as it spotlights particular idiosyncrasies and small-mindedness to the extent that only a master like Renoir could have accomplished it. However, the screenplay never calls too much awareness of the viciousness of its characters and Renoir enables his performers to ad-lib much of their dialogue which generally paints them with a noticeable warm-heartedness and sincerity. There's an abundance of energetic metaphors in this film with many interpretations to create a cutting edge social satire as much as it is a traditional parody.",2,55,0,"6,764","12,332",6-Jun-20,rated-9

It's about some vapid aristocrats, their servants, and all their twisted love affairs. It also features a lot of brilliantly realized social commentary and throws around some heavy metaphors and symbolism. For such a brief and deceptively light film, it's extremely complex and even disturbing at times. An early scene in which they all go on a trip to hunt fits in some brilliant subtext under all the brutality. Actual animals get slaughtered in this, which is a shock to the senses for a modern audience accustomed to laws preventing inhumane treatment of animals.  Despite this sickening fact, it's hard to deny the sheer power of the scene.  It's a visceral experience, with loud gun shots assaulting your ears.  The bloodied birds and rabbits struggling against death make you want to avert your eyes.  What it actually means beneath the surface makes the rest of the film tick in a way I didn't fully appreciate until I let it sit with me for a few days.   The cinematography is quite different from the soft, romantic textures and static camera I'm used to from the era. It looks much more modern than those other films, coming out a full two years before the ground-breaking Citizen Kane which I now realize wasn't alone in the ahead-of-its-time club. Everything is sharp and in focus, the crisp images complimenting the quick wit and edge of the dialogue.  Renoir's mastery of mise-en-scene is off the charts, especially in a lot of the scenes featuring the entire ensemble like the crazy climax at the party in the second half of the film. The camera really whips around with lots of urgency when it has to and quietly observes at other times.  The editing seems sudden at times, often mixing together wildly different kinds of action in quick succession. The camera is always an active participant in the film with a voyeuristic and observational point of view.  The look of the film is much more cinematic than the theatrics of the plot suggest.  The characters always act on their desires with little thought to the consequences of their actions. Wanting, taking, and destroying are their only concerns.  The silly nature of a lot of scenes, especially the ones with Christine declaring how much she loves some guy, underscore the characters' immaturity and petulance. For such a big ensemble, you also get an abundance of intimately depicted character moments throughout.  It's very clear Renoir didn't love these characters at all.  He judged them harshly and put all their flaws on display for derision.  This rich blend of satire, social critique, and soapy love entanglements begs to be rewatched to pick up all the little intricacies of the plot.  I know for sure I'll be dipping into this one many times over the years to come.  There's way too much to unpack on a first viewing.",5,25,0,775,"2,856",8-Jun-13,rated-10
The Rules of the Game,1939,106,drama,romance,comedy, ,16386,254 fans,4.08,30,73,97,329,477,1543,2085,4379,2951,4422," Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game plays like a relay race: scenes don't so much succeed one another as they intrude on each other. Renoir's camera follows whatever he deems most interesting from moment to moment, which gives the movie a free-wheeling energy that would feel chaotic if it weren't so masterfully staged. The film is a comedy of manners whose rhythm is more akin to jazz than classical music. Take the centerpiece moment for example: a grand fête in la Colinière, a French rural estate, where the lives of the French upper and lower classes come together to comedic and tragic effect. This sequence, lasting over 40 minutes, includes people dressed in bear costumes, several adulterers conspiring against each other and then working together a few minutes later, mistaken identities, guns drawn and fired, wives lying to their husbands, and mistresses drunk in love. Thanks to Renoir it never feels overwhelming. The camera flows freely through the estate's spacious halls, capturing lovers in an embrace or former enemies conspiring to bring down a new foe. One never gets the feeling that any one story takes precedence over the rest, instead we feel privileged for catching glimpses of all of them. Going back to the relay race analogy, it feels as if each moment is passing the baton forward, all contributing to bring the film to a victorious end. It ends with a bang (literally), but the closing it's neither a wholly satisfactory moment nor one that relishes in its downbeat nature. The romantic relationships at the center of the film, and there are about five or six of them between as many people, all start and end in the same place, but by bringing them all out in the open over the night, the people within those relationships are fundamentally changed, or at the very least they finally come to terms with who they really are. Think of the centerpiece party as a very classy, very French bacchanal where decency and manners are thrown out the window as champagne is being imbibed in copious amounts. And so we leave the guests in the middle of the night after they've all sobered up, unprepared to face the morning light. They might regret the previous night after waking up, but we surely won't.",1,19,0,222,414,2-Sep-14,rated-9

In my opinion, not the best description for a major film movement seeing as ‘poetic’ is a relatively non-descript term.  I suppose the realism part of it is attributed to the films’ themes of actual societal issues rather than the fantastical or the absurd.  It’s just French pre-war cinema and it was critical, along with the second movement ‘nouvelle vague’,  in shaping what we know and love today.  Add to that the fact that this has long been considered one of 5 greatest films ever made and you have the reasons why I chose Renoir’s The Rules of the Game as my viewing for this week’s theme. It is an early version of a template that would become extremely prevalent and recycled in countless films over time .  A group of aristocrats are assembled for a gathering and hunt at a lavish country manor.  The butler, the playboy host, the adventurous hero, the wife, the mistress…they are all invited and murder and mayhem is sure to ensue.   The title refers to the intricate and specific etiquette and premeditated social maneuvers of the elite upper crust, those that can only be learned and mastered from years of experience navigating such a strata.   The Rules of the Game is a social satire of the over-privileged and depicts a messy collision of multiple overlapping love triangles on a nation’s brink of cultural upheaval.  Though an entertaining and intelligently structured dramedy, the story is not what has catapulted this film to such a towering level of adoration in the canon of cinema I don’t think.   I chose to post this late on the eve of the Academy Awards because I feel that from all the films we have viewed so far, The Rules of the Game and other film from this movement most exemply what has become the formula to being  widely considered to be the best of film from any given year.  The Academy doesn’t usually  select comedies, horror or other genre thrillers in which to bestow its highest honor.  No, what seems to achieve  the consensus of ‘greatest film of a year’ is almost always a drama.  Not only a drama but one that has a story that addresses a relatable issue and manages to affect a large percentage of the population  at the gut level while pulling heartstrings.  Also, these films are often, not always, bolstered with a stylistic flair in their cinematography.   The Rules of the Game is the film that began to perfect this formula of what we know today as an Oscar movie.  It is ahead of its time in its production featuring complex shots with an incredibly mobile camera which demands the viewer’s attention.  Before this  you had your slapsticks and your adventure flicks shot mostly with stationary cameras but films like The Rules of the Game were a keystone in cinema, inspiring  the neo-realist movement and inevitably other game changers like Citizen Kane.   I know I haven’t discussed the film much but it is hard to judge it on its own basis.  It is certainly a fun time and it is technically very impressive.  To truly appreciate The Rules of the Game you really have to take into account everything it has shaped since.  What would you hand the Oscar to?  Should it go to our ‘favorite’ films that we had the most fun with like the slashers and the laugh-riots or should it go to the most important, dramatic and  ‘best’ movie?   My point is that this French movement in film is the reason today why most people consider ‘best’ to mean one of a very specific  type.  Not always, but almost always.   Anyway that was all wasted thoughts because most likely LaLa Land will win which is a musical and doesn’t fit into that who spiel at all.   Talk about a drama addressing topical social issues in an extremely cinematic way……Moonlight fits the mold so historical statistics are on its side.   Oh yeah and it has to be in English because the rest of world's brilliant work a'int gonna make no money if we gotta read subtitles y'all.  In fact, we are currently planning to build a wall around our country in order to keep out subtitles.",6,37,0,381,"1,542",26-Feb-17,rated-9

The perfect golden plate for the director to sink into deep into the visual and mannerist complexity of each of the characters intertwined in the bourgeois pompous and self-importance absorbed settings, while their distinctive and unique personalities very much reflect the dark historical context behind every subsequent tragic and also hilarious events of the movie. And to achieve it, he went for his own technical ambitions to capture his vision on the best cinematic form possible. It’s the use of visual language techniques at its most subtle and equally staggering brilliant in telling its story and the rules of its world, something quite impregnated within what Rules of the Game tackle, so it’s only natural that the style and technique presented, cheap in demonstration but rich in efficiency, would turn out to be some of the most subtlety brilliant ever put to film. The deep focus cinematography; the beautiful long takes that are telling multiple stories into one go; the mise-en-scene is a masterclass for cinema students and hungry movie goers with so much happening in so little and perfectly paced time. The power of chaotic cohesion that Renoir accomplishes here is savagely insane to even think about it. Now I understand why some say that this was pre-Orson Welles of making cinema before its own time, similarly as both share a common storytelling strategy on letting the editing and camera tell the story a step above its strong script! It’s memorably hilarious and downright cathartical entire final half cements everything the film is at that, but also on the human level that Renoir never forgets to leave at the forefront of its goals. Because above a technical marvel, the film is chaotic hilarious comedy but intimately dramatic tragedy for each of the characters. If not only a movie about its portrait of a society trivialized and ignored by the rules governing their social status, made up of false images, promises, and vows of sentiments created or dumped out of the mouth with no sustained or genuine emotional value. Jean Renoir himself playing the character of Octave, the poor friend who sacrifices his own feelings for the happiness of his beloveds, yet ends up in vain isn’t a gratuitous but almost necessary personal attachment from him inside this hard to grasp but inevitably thrilling story of disappointments and betrayals. It’s also as the events preceding the character of the pilot André Jurieux (Roland Toutain), a showcase about the death of its heroes, the death of all the principles of a nation and country. That everything that feels and looks wrong about every surrounding problematic of their current state, let alone be love affairs, jealousy quarrels and bigotry adultery feast of normality; it’s all just swept under the carpet and walked right over. As the nation was about to sink into the realm from the evils of war, its component society was already lost in its inner universes of illusions and disappointments. A satire?! A human nature portrait?! Both?! What matters is that this is nothing short of a masterpiece, and everyone can agree!",5,11,0,348,937,26-Dec-19,rated-10

You can fight hatred, but not boredom. Well, the whole thing's getting to me, too. Seeing you play shepherd to your Viennese shepherdess makes me want to yawn."" Over the summer, during a beautiful visit to Philadelphia, I visited the Barnes Foundation. There, I saw Renoir: Father and Son. The exhibit was a bit long, and focused heavily on the latter's filmography, and since I was unfamiliar with his work, I was intrigued, but mostly confused. I have obviously seen Auguste Renoir's paintings, and as I mentioned a few weeks ago in my review of Ménilmontant , I am a bit 50/50 with certain impressionist - Renoir being one of them. My issue with his work is that it does this bourgeois cliché where it insists that it ~taps into the humanity of all individuals: rich and poor~ but mostly ends up being a glorification of the beauty the wealthy can afford. I can't relate to these things, and so I personally find them boring, regardless of their merit. However, the way the Barnes curated the Renoir exhibit left me intrigued about the influence that could have on a son who, from his writing and interviews, seemed to struggle with his father's worldview, while still acknowledging his influence. This exhibit was my only exposure to Renoir prior to watching The Rules of Game. That, and the fact that it was supposed to be a 'comedy of manners.' Traditionally, this means Oscar Wilde. My presumption would be that this would have a similar tone, one that makes a mockery of elites, drenched in pure dramatic irony, where all the comedy is derived. This isn't that. Instead, it's one of those bourgeois quasi-theater/opera works that sympathizes with the rich, even though it claims not to do just that. It is exactly the think I hate about Renoir's father's paintings, and it is exactly the thing I believed Renoir was trying to get away from, but this just felt like 2 hours of sympathy for the devil. The work this reminds me most of, though, is Anna Karenina. In fact, the parallels between this and AK are nearly one-to-one. The cheating romancing plot is similar, the fight scene is similar, even Oblonsky is paralleled in Octave. The two narratives diverge at the final act, but I think that's also the moment where they thematically unite. Renoir's humanism as seen through the Mary Sue/self-insert's revelation is nearly identical to Tolstoy's in his work. It should come as no surprise that I was left cold by AK; I felt that it was a book that asked me to sympathize with the devil, but I also believed it was too elaborate, and buckled under that weight. I feel exactly the same way about The Rules of the Game. From a technical standpoint, there's a lot to love. The cinematography is elegant, the sets are gorgeous, and it's not like Renoir doesn't know what he's doing. The issue is that he knows his work too well. I can tell that he's still caught up in this world, still enchanted, and the glimmer in his eye is projected onto the camera's lens. Sure, there are some really great subtextual elements (the slave dolls v. hunting; the parallels of all the cheating couples; the early bubbling of facism and WWII as seen in the cook's monologue; the greenhouse; the car crash by a talented pilot) but none of them are necessarily deep. Time hasn't given a film like this anything to chew on. If anything, time's made it harder to appreciate these elements, because this is not how society works, and there's nothing for a [non-trust-fund] audience to latch onto. Worse, these elements are where most of the humor resides. But if it's no longer accessible, then it's no longer funny. So all I'm left with is over-elaborate sets and mediocre acting. (The acting is a result of the fact that this is post-silent era and pre-method acting. I felt like this would've been great had it had a method-acting cast, actually. Can I knock that element, really, though? That seems unfair. So I'll just point it out here.) These hurdled are compounded by the fact that a lot of the humor is, well, French humor, which is a particular brand of elitist humor that I never enjoyed or found funny, despite my pretentious tastes. In the end, I was left numb. There's no denying the sheer talent Renoir [and Bachelet] put on display here. I also don't think this is a narrative flop; it hits all the beats, although less like a traditional three-act screenplay and more like a longwinded Victorian novel. (Again, Tolstoy.) I also can't deny the influence this film's had, especially on indie films since the late 80s: early Ben Stiller [Reality Bites], Noah Baumbach, Greta Gerwig, Wes Anderson, PTA (at least his cinematography), the worst French New Wave had to offer [especially some of Godard's obnoxious stuff following the May '68 student protests]. Unsurprisingly, I hate all these filmmakers, outside of their early work - if only because while their early work is still dealing with the topics Renoir presents, it's also so outside the system that it still has critical bite. But it's all pretentious bullshit. That's all this is: pretense. Fluff. Elitist fodder. It feels shameful that Renoir does nothing here beside feed the ego of the elite. It's sadder that they were too caught up in themselves to see that this was, ultimately, on their side, and banned this film. I don't know if Renoir's other works are similar, but as a 'comedy,' I was, in a word, bored.  This wasn't my thing. I get why its beloved, and why its persisted, but I was bored. (On a final note, the main exhibit at the Barnes is beautiful and easily one of the most engaging museum experience I've ever had, so if you haven't seen it and you're in Philadelphia, go to the Barnes.)",11,7,3,237,562,27-Jan-19,rated-5

I mean, it's perfectly fine, good even, and as far as the canonized ""Great Films""  go it's probably even one of the better ones, but ultimately I have to admit that I admire it more than love it. That said, it was certainly worth watching again, especially on 35mm, if for no other reason than to figure out what it is that's eluding me about its greatness, and I might have even appreciated it slightly more this time, but even then honestly I can think of at least ten screwball comedies from the Thirties that I like a lot more than this.  It is quite funny in parts, but it sure takes a while to get to the good stuff. Basically everything from the actual party onward is pretty great, but I find everything prior to that a bit meh.

I can admit that the film wears its age well, and I do think it's interesting how unassuming the film's (admittedly impressive) technical innovations are. In this sense, Renoir is almost like the anti-Welles.

So why shouldn't simple people like us lie as well?"" ~ Octave The word ""masterpiece"" gets thrown around much too loosely in my opinion. This is one film that has been indelibly branded with that label since 1959, when it was painstakingly reconstructed from its near obliteration in World War II. I certainly believe ""Rules"" is a very good film, and I know most of my peers here rate it as a great film -- so many 5-star rankings. But out of the seven productions I have seen from director Jean Renoir now, I can't say I enjoyed it nearly as much as ""The Grand Illusion"" or ""French Cancan"" and I'm placing it about even with ""The River."" On the positive side, Nora Gregor was excellent as the displaced Austrian beauty Christine. She is unhappily married to the Marquis Robert de la Cheyniest (Marcel Dalio), ardently pursued by heroic aviator André Jurieux (Roland Toutain) and adored by her childhood friend Octave (Renoir himself). This motif of three men loving one woman appears in at least two of Renoir's later films, ""The Golden Coach"" and ""Elena and Her Men,"" but it is handled better here, with greater complexity of emotion and uncertainty of outcome. There are lots of other histoires de coeur introduced, too -- a veritable banquet of secret affairs, both upstairs among the bourgeois and downstairs among the hired help. Adultery, apparently, is the ""game"" of the title, attended by large portions of gossip and envy. Renoir does a fine job of making us dislike the various characters without actually hating them. For example, there is a scene where all the guests at the Marquis's country chateau go hunting for rabbits and pheasants, which is less of a sport than it is an organized massacre. However, knowing this was first released in 1939 on the cusp of war in Europe, it is rather easy to see the heartless bloodshed as a harbinger of real bloodletting to come. When asked by the Criterion Collection to explain why this film is a masterpiece, film critic Amy Taubin wrote, ""A social satire that is devoid of cynicism and its companion, sentimentality, and that evokes compassion rather than contempt is a rare thing. A cautionary tale that is as prophetic of today's tomorrows as of those many yesterdays ago is rarer still."" I totally understand that, and I kind of agree, but there's a massive plot hole the size of Alsace at the very heart of this film that caused me downgrade it by a full star. Without getting into spoilers, let's just say if a man commits criminal acts in front of a huge crowd of people, gets exiled for it and then does something even more criminal, is anyone going to accept without question that it was ""just an accident?"" I'm sorry, but the logic got stretched too far even for my warped mind.  Renoir once said he wanted to make a ""pleasant"" film that revealed the rot at the core of current society. I'd say mission accomplished on that goal. And as a bedroom farce, the film has held up really well. But this didn't refocus my world view, rattle my soul, or make me want to run to a church and confess all my sins. Call me jaded, but this ""very good"" film fails to reach the life-altering level of a cinematic masterpiece.  #8 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors Challenge",10,28,0,899,"2,968",6-Jun-15,rated-7

It's no surprise one of the most celebrated films of all time is a satire about upper class and love. A band of personalities playing their own periodic court drama of high society’s secret affairs. Filled with colorful characters Renoir creates quite a contrast between each person like our protagonist (if you want to call him that) Andre who has been declared national hero after flying across the Atlantic and back in record speed. What gives the whole film its crucial context and grounds it to more serious storyline is Andre’s passionate love for Christine in this otherwise unmoral tangle. After some persuasion from friends, Christine and her husband invite Andre along with many others to their country mansion which leads to one of the strongest outings in the poetic realism movement. It's poignant and painfully realistic yet stylistically separated from the mundane. Renoir paints these upper class affairs almost in a positive light, just a naturally occurring inconvenience, maybe even necessity in their lives. It makes fun of this ""vice"" by understating it but then revealing the absurdity and vanity of this lifestyle. Vanity, deception, cheating, superficiality. What even is love for these people? A way to patch their low self-esteem or disregard of other people? Lack of empathy that leads to circle of false behavior and becomes the norm. Perhaps they're in love but the word doesn't have that same weight as it should. In this sense I think it's also quite a modern film given changed views on relationships and marriage as a conservative institution. Renoir's virtue here is similar to All About Eve. These characters are not good people which is demonstrated to harrowing degree in the ending but the way Renoir operates makes you shift the blame and share your dislike among them. It becomes both a universal and personal critique which allows room for characters to embark on new journeys in your mind and makes you understand them. They're well drawn and the acting chops are fantastic, particularly great cast of women. Besides, many of them are rather charming and the dialogue often speaks about nothing but manages to say a lot because it resembles their selfish and shallow personalities in a highly entertaining fashion. There's no actual rules for the game. It's all a big joke until something comes back to bite your own leg. Laugh until you cry. The ending is incredibly direct statement and darkly comedic in almost superfluous way as Renoir pokes fun at the emptiness in which these people approach a tragedy like death. It’s almost like Lubitsch’s highly satirical To Be or Not to Be which is one of my favorite movies.",5,20,0,224,374,19-Jul-20,rated-8

For a comedy, it takes a very strong stance against frivolity and luxury. It's easy to see how, in the crux of 1939, with the German army looming overhead--the French ruling class probably did not feel too comfortable with a film telling them they were basically horribly out of touch and incapable of realizing what sad lives they truly lived.In execution, the Rules of the Game functions in three distinct acts--the set-up, the farcical second act, and the chilling third act. It's a really diverse structure, even if it adheres to its three parts--the latter two are so contrasted that it really just revels in its juxtaposition, really giving a depth to the second act upon reflection.With all that said, the second act is very funny for me, as a lover of farcical shenanigans. The open-and-close door style of filming really revels in that--it's a holdover from theater but something that is done exceptionally well here.",1,10,0,184,303,27-May-20,rated-7

The amount of visual detail he places in his film, combined with the fast-paced dialogue (in a language that forces me to read subtitles due to my lack of comprehension), ensure that every revisit produces more enjoyment. Able to focus less on the story, Renoir's mastery of framing and fleshing out scenes become clearly apparent. Long takes at a long distance are Renoir's specialty, allowing his actors to move more naturalistically, and get further into character. Renoir himself is brilliant as the bumbling Octave, who is a perfect blend between goof ball and sincere confidant, navigating the bizarre landscape that he himself has created in 1939 French high-society.

I had long ignored La Règle du jeu, expecting to think that here again would be a high quality film which I found personally unengaging.  Yet particularly to anyone with a liking for the early twentieth century witty country house story: Waugh, Mitford, Wodehouse and even the soapier recent creations of Julian Fellowes, this is a very accessible film. If you can watch Downton Abbey and are okay with subtitles, you should be able to watch this sharper-edged version. Unlike most screen visions of that world, it's contemporaneous, rawer, and the difficult bits are unmodified for the modern Sunday night TV and M&S ready-meal palate. Animals about to be hunted are shown alive, gentle, beautiful, moving and breathing. And because this was long before humane codes of practice, they are really shot with guns, on film. At least to some this would be an eye-opener to the brutal side of a romanticised world, both in the actuality of the scene and its symbolism of the social and political damage wrought. This Criterion essay mentions Beaumarchais as an inspiration, but whilst  La Règle du jeu has some of the same upstairs-downstairs farcical moments as found in him and Molière, the film has more humanity and generosity to all classes than such older satirical French plays.  Visually I found the film a little lacking: if something is this well-regarded I expect everything, and such a setting demands spectacular decadent beauty.  Yet otherwise it is perfectly poised; satire and empathy are in balance, with a wisdom and detachment that too few works of art possess. The haute bourgeoisie fiddles with one another's emotions as Europe is set to burn and all characters are presented so as one can be moved by their personal pain and amusements. Possibly it helps if you're someone who tends to see things in a similar manner anyway: ridiculous and pointless but also beautiful, emotive and justified. It's one of these works that I suspect is easiest to appreciate after a little life experience; I really don't think it would have seemed anything quite so special much before I was 30.  Whilst I'm not sure I would class this as one of the greatest five or so films ever, it is nice for once to understand what critics are on about as far as these most highly rated pictures are concerned.",6,15,5,111,766,2-Mar-13,rated-9

So with zero knowledge of the film, or Renoir in general, except the Kanopy suggestion “possibly the greatest film ever made” I dive into this, and looking the film up afterwards makes the story just curiouser and curiouser.  Can you make a film about “Dancing on the edge of a Volcano” if there is not a hint of the volcano in the movie? I guess you can, if everyone’s lives were so full of impending doom that they could see it anyway. Even the production of the film, with its absurd budget, constant rewriting, furious debates with a producer over casting himself, only to be released during a scary summer where there isn’t much interest, seems to illustrate this theme almost better than the final product.  I was occasionally uneasy watching this because it is hard to know what kind of movie you are watching. Is this meant to be a dark romantic drama, like a 19th century novel, an “Upstairs, Downstairs” farce, a Shakespearean/Mozartian frothy comedy, or a biting satire of the upper class? This is the kind of film that makes me think of one of the two Laws of criticism.  1. A classic is something which hasn’t finished what it has to say. We like to think of classics as those artistic works that stand still while the flavour of the moment comes and goes. But what if classics also move, just a bit more slowly?Shakespeare, for example has never been bigger, but there are a number of his works which we are produced less and less. Looking on Letterboxd today, this has a high score, but with a noticeable contingent of non-fans. I sense this is a movie that is hard for a modern audience to like.  The love that people have for this film is heavily influenced by the context in which it came out and later “rediscovered.” The lack of success at the box-office (later revised to “total failure” in the minds of some) together with the banning of the film lend it an air of lost treasure. The cataclysm of WWII gives “The Rules of the Game” a kind of retrospective grandeur. The fact that this made it to the famous Sight and Sound list in a cut version with a much lesser quality ending is just another strange moment in history of this movie.  If this is movie about the eccentricity of the upper class, why do the “downstairs” crew seem to be involved in many shenanigans of their own?  In terms of technical aspects, many have commented on the depth of field and ability to keep large parts of the action in focus, as well as smart camera movement, but this is not something that is very obvious when I watch this. We get good coverage but the cinematography and editing seem pedestrian by modern standards.  Renoir would have gained much if he had been able to film in Technicolor, it is not nearly as pretty as it hopes to be, considering the set and the budget.  As for the performances, they are all quite good. The character of Lisette pops out as one of the highlights of the smaller roles, Renoir does well as the sad clown Gustave. Our central trio all have their moments as well. I know not everyone loves Gregor in the role of Christine. It is true she doesn’t give the air of a siren like the classic blonde Bombshells of the screen. Christine is presented as a handsome and capable woman who fits into a Tweed Jacket for hunting just as easily as a black frock for evening wear. She is not meant to be tantalising tease in the mould of a Marlene Dietrich role.  This review has gone off the rails a little bit so a couple of final points.  1. How many rabbits had to die to make this?? There was a lot of seemingly actual shooting during the hunting scene, which didn’t help the plot much or look pretty either. (I also realised I am from a very different social class when these folks are very familiar with pheasants and Are shocked by the sight of a squirrel. Lol) 2. Were audiences at the time supposed to recognise the one house guest as gay from that remark he made? It seems a bit scandalous in 1939 to have done this? 3. Were we supposed to take all the “jokes” about Jews, black people, etc. seriously? Are those bits meant to be illustrative or satirical? I have many questions about this movie, and perhaps I’ll have to rewatch alongside some other Renoir films.",15,11,0,297,227,1-May-20,rated-8

Andy downloads the film illegally (badass) and watches it with Jim and Pam. During the viewing, Jim and Pam discuss Pam’s parents failing marriage by stating the reasons behind their split. Andy, hilariously, does not realize Jim and Pam aren’t talking about the movie. He is bewildered by their statements and they cause him to believe that Jim and Pam are not only movie geniuses, but that he is, in fact, a complete dullard who can’t even follow the plot of a movie.  This movie made me feel like Andy. And there are thousands of Jim and Pam’s out there that are making me feel like I don’t deserve to watch and discuss films, let alone try. While doing research for this film (reading the Wikipedia page about it), I found out that some film critics believe this to be one of the greatest films of all time. I also discovered that Jean Renoir is considered to a borderline genius filmmaker, and one of the first filmmakers to be known as an auteur. While watching The Rules of the Game, I was on a very different wavelength than these critics (along with the vast majority of people on this site.) I do want to say I appreciated a lot of what this film did and there were a number of scenes that were very engaging. The acting was terrific and the movie certainly picked up from the incredibly boring beginning. The characters worked together to create a confusing and surprisingly uninteresting story where everyone is tricking, sleeping with, or murdering the other characters. It was so overwhelming that it became underwhelming, a story so full of emotion that I emotionally checked out before it even hit the halfway mark.  I completely understand that this was a shocking commentary on the moral failings of the ruling class in France at the time of release, but in the 21st century, this feels more like a soap opera than a scathing and groundbreaking story of moral callousness. Rich French people like to fuck? Who knew?!?!  I’m disappointed by this film, but I’m so interested in the themes and positive reception it received that I am going to read a ton of positive reviews of it and see what I was missing.",7,12,3,92,51,28-Jan-19,rated-5

For Renoir it was the hypocrisy, selfishness, moral instability and narrow-mindedness of the people who were considering themselves the elites of societies across Europe that let Nazis to build their war machine and surprise the intellectually superficial individuals whose only goal in life was to deceive other people’s wives.  In retrospective The Rules of the Game is surely among the most profound and farsighted films ever made, it gives a spot-on analysis of the roots of WWII even before the war began, of course the political conflicts were escalating back in 1939 before Nazi army invaded Poland but Renoir’s ability of creating a connection between what he believed to be the failure of moral and ethical values in French society and the ongoing and mounting political tensions in Europe is praiseworthy and exemplary. So in a broader scale The Rules of the Game is not just a cinematic masterpiece, it is a piece of history warning all of us that abandoning the values that made us a functional community at first place may lead to some dire and uncontrollable consequences. Like The Grand Illusion one of the main themes of the film is the lack of a healthy and productive relationship between social classes, Renoir portrays a society where it is impossible for individuals from different classes to understand each other, they see each other as enemies, they use every opportunity to cheat on each other and the only thing that goes on between them is a certain type of hatred and mistrust. But the problems exist even within a single class as well, Renoir gives us a society where everyone – male and female - is busy cheating on his/her own partner, everyone’s thinking about their own instantaneous desires and therefore all of them are doing everything possible - without caring for other people’s feelings or their freedom – to gain more pleasure. And when a group of people with the same parasitic mentality and attitude gather around in one isolated place the big farce beings, a foolish, senseless, barbaric and primitive show which is constantly swinging between comedy and tragedy. The Rules of the Game looks incredibly fresh as if it was made yesterday and about the world we’re living in and not the doomed Europe of 30s. There are some shocking and hair-raising similarities between what Renoir portrays in his film and what is happening in our time.

In order to create a story that properly imbues broad meaning in specific context, it requires the author to populate the story with characters that feel authentic acting out a plot with widespread applicability. This is understandably a very tricky balance to find; many stories with allegorical intentions tend to either become too absorbed in the story to feel especially meaningful, or hit the nail far too squarely on the head to the point where the audience feels as if they are being bludgeoned. The Rules of the Game is ostensibly an allegory, but it's one that is muddled and unspecific, and which pussyfoots too much on it's commentary for it hold much of any value (in my eyes). On an explicit level, the movie seeks to act as criticism of the bourgeoisie class, damning the cruelty that hides behind their civil manners. In practice, the movie feels remarkably unspecific in it's commentary. Much of this is fundamentally rooted in Renoir's treatment of the ensemble of characters; he extends sympathy to the entire cast, having their ""callous"" behavior often feel more like spurts of horrid behavior than the essence of their moral character. This would be fine in a movie that wasn't so overtly trying to act as a broad statement on human behavior, but as it stands, it declaws the movie of much of it's bite. There are standout sequences that are clearly designed to convey broadly critical meaning; the hunting sequence does impart a sense of injustice at the treatment of any kind of life for sport, and the party sequence, in which Schumacher goes off with the gun, is clearly ridiculing the idea of maintaining civil mannerisms in a time of clear chaos and violence.  Beyond these isolated concessions of clear satire, the movie generally seems to side somewhere closer to sympathy with it's cast, extending judgment on their actions without doing much to expose their innate character. I think this is in large part due to Renoir's innate privilege of perspective; coming from an affluent family, Renoir would have innate sympathy with a cast that largely belongs to the social class he has always been a part of. It's no accident that Schumacher, the groundskeeper, is responsible for the violence and chaos in a film that professes to ridicule the rich. They might be ""callous"" in their pettiness, but they would obviously never go so far as to raise arms against another human being, because they're still decent people in the end!  My personal biases certainly soured me against this movie, to a degree. I don't really give a rat's ass about the trifles of the rich when the trifles are played straight; love triangles and affairs between the socially affluent is about the least relatable plot setup a story could ever have for the majority of the population. In addition, I really don't like the inherent condescension found in the overwhelming majority of stories about classism made by members of the upper-class. Fritz Lang's Metropolis is similarly disingenuous; both movies address the fact that inequality exists, and that the 1% doesn't relate to the needs of the regular people, before dancing around a resolution that actually confronts the inequality that drives the conflict. The romantic angle in The Rules of the Game could make for a stronger comedy of errors had class not been a factor, but as is, it feels like a cop-out so that the movie can avoid having the conflict rooted in the innate flaws that come with having a ruling class in any society.  The movie fares much better as an omen for the war. There's a pervasive tone of melancholy, best felt in it's ending but persistent all throughout. This may be one of the best autumn movies if only because of the persistent feeling of knowing that the current peace is soon to fade to conflict and tragedy. There's no way of knowing exactly how intentional or explicit Renoir meant for this ominous atmosphere to be when originally conceiving the film, but taken as a parable for war (especially when considering WW2 was in it's earliest stages when the film was being made), I think it succeeds as a ""loss of innocence"" narrative. However, I think this is largely a secondary intention of the film, as all of the research and documentation on the film's production clearly indicates it serving as a social critique first and foremost.  On a technical level, the movie is clearly excellent. It suffers from the ""Seinfeld Effect"" in that it's innovations are largely unnoticeable due to how influential it would end up becoming, but Renoir is fantastic at staging the ensemble in interesting ways. The camera will frequently track the intricate blocking with long takes and panning shots, giving the movie an almost invisible technical presence that highlights the intricacies of the plotting and performance. Countless directors have taken cues from the way that the staging of the story was so seamlessly executed, and it feels like a stylistic foundation that would go on to inspire works that took the approach to directions both more languorous and frenetic. The Rules of the Game isn't without merit. It packs in a lot of commentary on a fairly wide variety of subjects, and makes an earnest attempt to be truly incisive in it's allegory. However, it's a muddled message, as Renoir's innate sympathy for the very people he seeks to critique declaws the movie of almost any biting pertinence. In addition, the romantic plotting is as convoluted as it is uninteresting, flaccid characters enacting a trite plot that manages to sidestep saying much of anything in the end. It's a worthwhile watch for it's technical strength and historical significance, but beyond that, I fail to see the appeal that has made this so canonically revered as one of the best films of all time. Why anyone thinking the son of an affluent impressionistic painter could ever make a damning statement on classism is honestly beyond me; in the world of the film the rich may be petty, but they are ultimately excused from being truly heinous.",7,17,0,526,734,3-May-20,rated-5
The Rules of the Game,1939,106,drama,romance,comedy, ,16386,254 fans,4.08,30,73,97,329,477,1543,2085,4379,2951,4422," Every great movie holds two similar distinctions: they appear fresh and modern, no matter when they were made, and they are almost always ahead of their time. Of all of these movies, Jean Renoir’s seminal The Rules of the Game (Le règle du jeu) might be the most notorious of the bunch. When it opened in 1939, Rules of the Game caused such a commotion that audience members started fighting one another in the theater while one patron lit his newspaper on fire and tried to burn the place down. The movie was panned and slammed in the press, hacked from a 113 minute running time to 85 by the studio and eventually banned by the French Government in October 1939 for, “being depressing, morbid, immoral [and] having an undesirable influence over the young”. Then in 1956, original prints of the movie were discovered by Jean Gabarit and Jacques Marechal and under the supervision of Renoir and Jacques Durand, Rules of the Game was restored to its fully glory. The restoration was dedicated to Renoir’s greatest admirer, critic André Bazin, who died in 1958, and when the properly restored Rules of the Game played the 1959 Venice Film Festival, it was deemed as a masterpiece. Why was Rules of the Game so terribly hated in 1939 and so beloved only twenty-years later? Rules of the Game is a searing movie, one that mocks the upper-middle class — depicting them as spoiled, love-sick little brats with money — and places the blame of the nearing war on their shoulders. Talking with Alexander Sesonske in 1980, Renoir noted that the society in Rules of the Game was, “in the process of disintegration … the audience recognized this. The truth is that they recognized themselves. People who commit suicide do not care to do it in front of witnesses.” To depict that society, Renoir set the standard for the upstairs-downstairs comedy by filling his movie with romantic dalliances and hurt feelings, all masked by social manners and personal motivations. As Octave (played by Renoir himself) states in one of the movies most infamous scenes, “The awful thing about life is this: Everybody has their reasons.” The Rules of the Game opens with André (Roland Toutain) returning from a Trans-Atlantic solo flight. He lands in Paris where the press and hoards of fans eagerly await his safe return. Of all the people there, the one who is not present is Christine (Nora Gregor), which Octave sadly informs him. André is heartbroken and immediately tells a nearby radio reporter that he did this for her, and she didn’t even bother to come. Of course, André protects Christine’s identity by not revealing her name, yet he choses this public moment to shame her. This intersection of private and public is the first of many in Rules of the Game, a movie with no central character or concrete story. Instead, Renoir chooses to play his drama out on a grand-stage (photographed in deep focus so that the audience can take in every aspect of every character) where all the players are aware that they are dancing on stage. What they aren’t aware of, to quote Renoir, is that they are, “dancing on a volcano.” After a series of prologues where Renoir introduces the major players, the scene shifts to Christine’s country château, La Colinière, in Sologne. Octave and André are invited, as is Christine’s boyfriend, Robert (Marcel Dalio), who is still in love with his mistress, Geneviève (Mila Parély), but trying to break it off. Robert invites Geneviève to the château as well, hoping that she and André will fall in love and solve everyone’s problem. They don’t, and the staff of the château further complicates the matters with their own affairs. If any of this seems a little, Downton Abbey-ish, it’s because Abbey scribe, Julian Fellows, also wrote the script for Robert Altman’s 2002 film Gosford Park, a movie that is practically in cahoots with Rules of the Game. Some movies are timeless, but great movies continue conversations long after the cameras stop rolling. When Rules of the Game was released, Europe was on the brink of war and Renoir’s mocking of the classes did not go over well. Nor did the infamous hunting sequence where party members cheerfully gun down rabbits and pheasants. Rapidly cutting back and forth between images of the party members and the fallen animals, a barrage of shotgun blasts on the soundtrack drive the message home. Real hunting was going on, only a few hundred miles away, and that allusion did not escape audiences then, and it still doesn’t today. The Rules of the Game is a masterpiece. It is one of the pillars upon which cinematic grammar was formed. By using deep focus, long shots, quick cuts and a freely moving camera, Renoir transformed the medium into something completely different. It may not have been well received in 1939, but today, it is properly regarded and continues to shape and inspire the cinema of today and tomorrow. michaeljcinema.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/the-rules-of-the-game/",11,8,0,57,"1,095",29-Apr-15,rated-9

A very happy birthday to Paul Schrader, one of the greats, and one of my favorites. I might watch one of his movies later tonight, but in case I don't, this was its own way to honor him. My man Paul was once quoted with saying """"If one movie can stand for all others, represent all that film can be, that film is The Rules of the Game."" I'm not sure he could be anymore positive on a movie than that, and his praise of the film was enough for me to want to check this out. I'll admit that I never really connected with this one, but I can give credit where credit is due and say that for being a film made at its time, it's at least technical standpoint very impressive. It's nice to look at, and it weaves all of its characters together in a mostly clean and effective way. If you would be in the mood to see a bunch of uptight, rich French people treat others like them and those below them with either passivity or outright cruelty, this could be the movie for you. It was at the time of its release made by Jean Renoir knowing that World War II was on the way, and he wanted to make a war movie where war is never seen or even mentioned. It makes for a decent examination of the callousness of the elite, and how status and power can come crashing down for anyone at the drop of a hat if they're not paying close enough attention. I enjoyed it most when it leaned more into its farcical elements, but I don't regret giving it a watch for Paul.

I have at last witnessed the beloved source code for Gosford Park, my favorite Altman masterpiece, and I'm surprised. I wasn't expecting anything half as frenetic and funny. I wasn't expecting barely controlled chaos.  It really is, sequence by sequence, a marvel of mad choreography and inspired cinematography. Many have called it ""ahead of its time"" or ""strangely modern,"" but show me something being made today that moves like this movie does in so many directions at once. At times I feel a sort of suspense that reminds me of watching Russian Ark: I'm half-expecting the film to collapse under the weight of its own extravagant architecture, or to break apart in its own flamboyance. It feels like it will dance itself to pieces. And yet, as we careen through this vast house, following mad men as they chase and clutch at and spank anything female within reach, as we try to track the fickle and fluctuating infatuations and lusts and marriages and affairs, never finding anyone to root for or anything to believe in within this crowded community of liars and opportunists, there is something still that holds it all together. What it it? The obvious answer is Renoir himself, who, seeming to design a whole new kind of cinema from scratch, is clearly inspired.  But in this French-est of farces, what gives the complicated narrative any integrity or coherence? Friends and colleagues have complained that the characters here are shallow and unrelatable — but I see a madly inspired tapestry of comic threads, each character both a political cartoon and a possible redemption story. It's the darkest and most cynical of portraits of human society, and thus unnervingly truthful — nobody is a saint, but nobody is an unredeemable sinner. Unrelatable? I suspect that this is exactly what even the best of us looks like to our Maker. And yet, Renoir doesn't seem to hold this community in contempt: There's an affection for each character here, and perhaps that's why I catch glimmers of grace in the circus of folly. Characters who seem one-dimensionally reprehensible in their hypocrisy and selfishness are at their worst one minute and then, against all odds, almost endearingly sympathetic in another, as they suddenly glimpse a possibility of love and renewal and reinvention.  Take Robert, for example: the host, the husband, who leaves his longtime lover to try be true to his wife. Their marriage is a joke, but in spite of that, perhaps because of that, he wearily surrenders his life of unfaithfulness and tries what makes no sense: to live as if their marriage were real. He's revolting, morally bankrupt, and still prone to dallying with a jealous mistress. But there are moments where I believe he might actually be trying, might be responding in spite of himself to some faint trace of conscience, might be angling to make one more feeble at being true.  Neither Robert nor any of his guests will find true love before it's over — the movie exists to expose our humiliation and failure. It even goes so far as to suggest that these unrestrained passions will inevitably lead to actual casualties, a sobering turn for a comedy. But in doing so it amplifies our conviction that True Love is possible. For, if it weren't, why would we feel so exasperated by these characters' constant failures to find it in one another? How can these humans be measured as fools if there were not a true ideal within reach by which we measure their shortcomings? By watching them dash about the field in a treasure hunt and finding next-to-nothing, we can clearly see their superficiality, their enslavement to their whims and lusts, their incapacity for faithfulness and selflessness and something more substantial than swooning and sex. The demonstration of Everything True Love Isn't leaves us with an outline of What Love Is. Perhaps the film that it reminds me of most, strangely, is Uncut Gems. Hear me out. Here are morally bankrupt characters who have no concept of Wisdom or Love, but who need that light so badly that they chase reflections and refractions of it like cats after lasers, with such reckless disregard for anyone but themselves that they wreck everyone's world in the process. Where Uncut Gems' Howard is chasing the meaningless Big Score as if it's the only form of Transcendence he has a hope of reaching, everybody in Renoir's film is chasing the romantic ideal of Bliss — but what they're chasing won't fulfill them because they think it's something they can grasp and hold. They don't understand it's something they can only receive by giving. And, in the the process, what they're betraying they've botched beyond hope.  The two movies run on a similar adrenaline. We can shake our heads and say ""What fools! What is it you think all of this striving will get you?"" But there is something genuine in their drive, a longing to touch something real that is Against All Odds. They have a sense that all existing human contracts are insufficient, and the Sublime will only be found by abandoning those fradulent forms and reaching for something more. For all of Renoir's lampooning of the self-centered things we do for lust in the name of love, the movie is nevertheless filled with an abiding sense that love exists, that it really could change things, and that it is possible for anyone.  I still prefer what Robert Altman has done with this template established by Renoir. Gosford Park's characters are much more complicated, nuanced, and recognizably human. Julian Fellows's dialogue is exquisite. And the film's ensemble-cast glory is among the finest I've ever seen — only Merchant & Ivory's A Room With a View compares, I think. The sound design is innovative. And I come away with a more moving vision of how love can be possible in epiphanic humility.  But now, at last, I know that even Altman at his best could not, in some aspects, match his inspiration. His version of the hunting-and-shooting scene, for instance, serves its narrative purpose but never even feigns an attempt at matching Renoir's original take. That hunting sequence is absurd, horrifying, and astonishing in its execution. And if I never watch this film again, it'll be because of those rabbits.

I'll catch up on what I missed when I have more time, but for now I'm just continue from here. I'm not too experienced with French Poetic Realism, so I had a hard time deciding on what film I should watch. I was going to watch The Grand Illusion (which I will definitely check out at some point), but I heard great things about The Rules of the Game, so I decided to watch that instead. Boy am I glad that I did. The Rules of the Game is an extremely fast paced, chaotic and entertaining film. From the very first frame, this film never lets you take a breath. Characters lie, cheat and fight (both verbally and physically). There are so many twists and turns, you never know what's going to happen next. Jean Renoir did a fantastic job directing this film. The film has an extremely large cast of characters, and every single one felt well developed. Although none of the characters are innocent, you can easily resonate with them and understand their actions.

Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof.” Why is this film so realistic? I was just watching this movie because I got a Halloween costume that represents the main character in this film. I did expect it to be a political thriller that is about the corruption of News media and the results that it could lead too. All of this makes V for Vendetta age so beautifully. It is a very relevant movie and it probably will stay relevant forever. It does a great job with its message about the media and riots. There is a lot to take away from this movie with its themes and layers.  However, does the story hold up? A woman named Evey comes across a mysterious masked man named V who saves her from a group of thugs. He takes her to a view where a building gets destroyed and there are fireworks. The BTN then labels V a terrorist and they go out of there way to hunt him down. V sends a message about being part of the rebellion on November 3.  That is probably the simplest way to describe the plot. V for Vendetta is a very deep film that has plenty of layers with its world-building, story, imagery and characters. There are a couple of characters that are truly evil, but most of them are morally grey. V himself has good intentions, but he does do a few bad deeds and Finch is part of the BTN, but he wants what’s best for the citizens. This movie is ultimately about how the media can control the viewers’ perception of what is happening in the country as well as certain topics. They painted V is as a monster that was disrupting chaos which is not all of the way wrong, but they cause more chaos than stop it. The movie is also about rebelling against the authorities. There is a lot to unpack here and it may take you more than a couple of watches to catch everything. The soundtrack is great. The musical score haunting and there is some classical bits in there. The visuals are gorgeous with the costume for V looking really sharp. The colors are very stylish in a dark and gritty way. The cinematography is stunning, but what really caught my eye was the way certain shots were edited. The shot where Evey and V are getting ready for the day all while watching a broadcast from BTN is sheer genius. If there a film that you want to watch to see how you can edit sequences, watch V for Vendetta. It’s pretty mind blowing. There is not a whole lot of action here, but the few scenes there are look great. The last fight between V, Creedy and his goons is visually appealing and stylish. The performances are terrific with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving killing it as the leads. Portman’s character goes through so much and her expressions and delivery is perfect. I did not even recognize her. I did not recognize Weaving’s voice either. These two performances are stellar. Overall, V for Vendetta is a great film and a terrific piece of political commentary. It is scary how realistic and relevant this movie is. It is also very entertaining and interesting to watch. Viewers will probably be left with more than a few questions about if this film is similar to the events happening now. Either way, this is one hell of an experience.",6,15,0,595,526,29-Oct-20,rated-8

Ich genieße das ebenso sehr wie jeder andere Mensch, aber anlässlich eines Gedenktages, mit dem bedeutende Ereignisse aus der Vergangenheit, für gewöhnlich der Tod einer Berühmtheit oder das Ende eines grässlich blutigen Krieges, mit einem hübschen Feiertag begangen werden, dachte ich mir, dass wir diesen fünften November, ein Tag, dessen heute leider nicht mehr gedacht wird, erinnerungswürdig machen, indem wir den Alltag vergessen und ein wenig plaudern.Natürlich gibt es jene, die nicht wollen, dass wir reden. Ich vermute, dass bereits jetzt Befehle in Telefone gebrüllt werden und schon bald Männer mit Waffen unterwegs sind.Darum, auch, wenn man den Schlagstock anstelle eines Gesprächs einsetzen kann, werden Worte immer ihre Macht behalten.Worte lassen einen Sinn erschließen, und für die, die bereit sind zuzuhören, formulieren sie die Wahrheit, und die Wahrheit ist, dass etwas in diesem Land ganz fürchterlich im Argen liegt, nicht wahr?Grausamkeit und Ungerechtigkeit, Intoleranz und Unterdrückung. Wo man einst die Freiheit zu widersprechen besaß, zu denken und zu reden, wie man es für richtig hielt, hat man nun die Zensoren und Überwachungssysteme, die einen zu Konformität zwingen und zur Unterwerfung führen.Wie konnte es dazu kommen? Wer hat Schuld? Nun, sicherlich hat manch einer mehr zu verantworten als Andere, und er wird auch zur Rechenschaft gezogen, doch um ehrlich zu sein:Wer einen Schuldigen sucht, der muss nur in den Spiegel sehen.Ich weiß, warum ihr es getan habt. Ich weiß, dass ihr Angst hattet. Wer hätte das nicht?Krieg, Terror, Krankheit – Myriaden von Problemen haben sich dazu verschworen, eure Vernunft zu manipulieren und euch eures Verstandes zu berauben.Angst gewann die Oberhand, und in eurer Panik habt ihr euch an den heutigen Großkanzler gewendet: Adam Sutler.Er versprach euch Ordnung, er versprach euch Frieden. Als Gegenleisung forderte er nur euer gehorsames Einverständnis.Gestern Nacht wollte ich dem Schweigen ein Ende bereiten. Gestern Nacht habe ich das Old Bailey zerstört, um dieses Land an das zu erinnern, was es vergessen hat.Vor über vierhundert Jahren wollte ein großer Bürger den fünften November für immer in unser Gedächtnis brennen. In der Hoffnung, die Welt daran zu erinnern, dass Hoffnung, Gerechtigkeit und Freiheit mehr als Worte sind: Es sind Perspektiven.Wenn ihr also nichts gesehen habt, wenn euch die Verbrechen dieser Regierung auch weiterhin unbekannt sind, dann schlage ich vor, dass ihr den fünften November unbemerkt vergehen lasst.Aber wenn ihr seht, was ich sehe, wenn ihr spürt, was ich spüre, und wenn ihr strebt, wonach ich strebe, dann fordere ich euch auf, an meiner Seite zu stehen, heute in einem Jahr vor dem Eingang des Parlaments, und dann bescheren wir ihnen einen fünften November, der nie und nimmer vergessen wird!"" Guy Fawkes und das englische Parlament Guy Fawkes und seine Mitverschwörer versuchten am 5. November 1605, das englische Parlament im Palast von Westminster in London zu sprengen. Das Motiv war Rache am König, da dieser die katholische Bevölkerung unterdrückte. Für das Attentat hatte er bereits 36 Fässer mit mehr als zwei Tonnen Schwarzpulver in den Kellern der Gebäude deponiert (daher auch die englische Bezeichnung „Gunpowder Plot“ für das Attentat), die er zu diesem Zweck als Lagerraum gemietet hatte. Fawkes plante, mit dem Anschlag am Tag der Parlamentseröffnung im House of Lords König Jakob I. samt Familie, alle Parlamentsmitglieder, alle Bischöfe des Landes und den Großteil des Hochadels zu töten sowie anschließend einige politische Gefangene aus dem Tower von London zu befreien. Anschließend sollte ein katholischer König eingesetzt werden.Guy Fawkes und der eingelagerte Sprengstoff wurden dann vom Friedensrichter Thomas Knyvet am Morgen des 5. November bei einer Inspektion der Keller unter dem Parlament entdeckt. Unter Folter bekannte der in den Tower gebrachte Fawkes sein geplantes Verbrechen und nannte auch seine Mitverschwörer, die am 30. Januar 1606 durch Hängen, Ausweiden und Vierteilen hingerichtet wurden. Einen Tag später sollte auch Guy Fawkes hingerichtet werden. Er verkürzte die Strafe, indem er kurz vor dem Hochziehen mit der Schlinge um den Hals vom Galgenpodest sprang und sich das Genick brach.  Im Vereinigten Königreich wird die Vereitelung des Attentats jedes Jahr am 5. November unter dem Namen „Bonfire Night“ gefeiert. Dabei finden in vielen Orten Straßenumzüge oder ein Fackelzug statt, bei dem eine Guy-Fawkes-Puppe verbrannt wird und Feuerwerke entzündet werden. Scherzhaft sagt man in Großbritannien, dass Guy Fawkes der einzige Mann sei, der je mit ehrlichen Absichten in das Parlament ging. Die jährliche Parlamentseröffnung beginnt bis heute traditionell mit der Inspektion der Kellergewölbe unterhalb des House of Lords durch die Yeomen of the Guard. Ein in mehreren Variationen bekannter Kinderreim, eigentlich die ersten beiden Verse der ersten Strophe eines Liedes, ruft das Ereignis in Erinnerung: “Remember, rememberthe Fifth of NovemberGunpowder, treason and plot;I see no reasonwhy gunpowder treasonShould ever be forgot.”  Der britische Autor Alan Moore und der Zeichner David Lloyd griffen die Figur literarisch wieder auf, indem sie den Protagonisten ihrer erfolgreichen dystopischen Graphic Novel V wie Vendetta (1982, verfilmt 2005) als Guy Fawkes verkleidet agieren ließen.  Alan Moore und der Comic Alan Moore gilt als einer der besten Comic-Autoren und in seinem Werk nimmt V for Vendetta eine herausragende Stellung ein. Inhaltlich setzt sich das Werk unter anderem mit der Frage „Heiligt der Zweck die Mittel?“ auseinander, mit dem Anarchismus und dem Sinn des Leidens Einzelner. Bezeichnend ist, dass Moore auf die aufgeworfenen Fragen keine fertigen Antworten liefert. Zwar soll der Leser spontan mit dem Widerstand gegen die faschistische Diktatur sympathisieren, gleichzeitig wird jedoch deutlich, dass auch V Gewalt gegen Unschuldige anwendet. Er wird als Villain, als Schurke, vorgestellt und trägt bei all in seinen Plänen sichtbarer Rationalität starke psychopathische Züge dar. Es bleibt auch unklar, wer V eigentlich ist. Dass es auf die Person, die V einmal war, nicht ankommt, wird am Schluss überdeutlich, als Evey vom sterbenden V die Aufgabe bekommt herauszufinden, wer hinter der Maske steckt, ohne jemals Vs Gesicht sehen zu dürfen. Die Mehrdeutigkeit drückt sich schon im Zeichen V aus, das für den Buchstaben, die römische Zahl oder auch das Victoryzeichen stehen kann. Auch in der Wahl der darstellenden Mittel gingen die beiden Macher neue Wege. Auf Veranlassung von Lloyd wurden Gedankenblasen weggelassen und Geräusche nicht mehr wie üblich als lautmalerische Worte, sondern nur noch zeichnerisch dargestellt. Moore ging noch darüber hinaus und schaffte auch die Textkästen fast völlig ab, welche die gezeichnete Handlung zusätzlich erklären und interpretieren. Alle Kapitel – in der deutschen Übersetzung bis auf das letzte Kapitel – beginnen mit dem Buchstaben V.  Dieser Comic V wie Vendetta (Vendetta italienisch für „Blutrache“) erschien ursprünglich ab 1982 in schwarz-weiß im britischen Comicmagazin Warrior, konnte dort aber aufgrund der Pleite des Magazins nicht zu Ende geführt werden. Ab 1988 erschien eine kolorierte Fassung bei DC in zehn Folgen, dort wurde auch erstmals das letzte Drittel der Geschichte veröffentlicht. In Deutschland erschien 1991 eine 6-bändige kolorierte deutsche Ausgabe „V wie Vendetta“ bei comicArt und von Speed Comics 2002 unter dem gleichen Titel in der ursprünglichen schwarz-weißen Fassung (ISBN 3-936068-12-7).Im Vorfeld der Filmpremiere erschien eine neue deutschsprachige Fassung in Farbe bei Panini Comics, die durch sehr viele Rechtschreib- und Grammatikfehler den Inhalt schmälerte. Die Geschichte des Comic spielt in einem fiktiven England von 1997, in dem nach einem dritten Weltkrieg eine faschistische Partei die Macht übernommen hat, die von der titelgebenden Figur V, einem Anarchisten und Terroristen, im Alleingang bekämpft wird.Zentrales Thema ist die selbstbestimmte Freiheit des Individuums und der Gesellschaft sowie der Gegensatz zwischen Freiheit und Macht. Moore´s Inspiration für den Comic  Das politische Klima Großbritanniens in den frühen 1980er Jahren beeinflusste auch die Arbeit. Moore ging davon aus, dass die konservative Regierung von Margaret Thatcher ""offensichtlich die Wahlen von 1983 verlieren würde"" und dass sich eine neue, von Michael Foot geführte Labour-Regierung für eine vollständige nukleare Abrüstung einsetzt würde es dem Vereinigten Königreich ermöglichen, nach einem begrenzten Atomkrieg relativ unversehrt zu entkommen. Moore war jedoch der Ansicht, dass Faschisten ein Post-Holocaust-Großbritannien schnell untergraben würden. V, ein Anarchist, ermordet anfangs Mitglieder der faschistischen Regierung, aber während sich die Geschichte entwickelt, hat Moore absichtlich Vs Handlungen ""sehr, sehr moralisch mehrdeutig"" gemacht mit dem Ziel, ""Ich wollte den Leuten nicht sagen, was sie denken sollen, ich nur wollte den Leuten sagen, sie sollen nachdenken."" Alan Moore und der Film Alan Moore distanzierte sich vom Film, wie er es bei anderen Filmadaptionen seiner Arbeiten getan hat. Er beendete die Zusammenarbeit mit seinem Verleger, DC Comics, nachdem seine Konzernmutter, Warner Bros., Aussagen über Moores angebliche Billigung des Films nicht wiederrufen konnte.  Nach dem Lesen des Drehbuchs bemerkte Moore:Der Film wurde von Menschen gemacht, die zu schüchtern sind, um eine politische Satire in ihrem eigenen Land aufzustellen, zu einer Parabel aus der Bush-Ära gegen einen Staat, der von Neokonservativen geführt wird - darum ging es in dem Comic V wie Vendetta nicht. Es ging um Faschismus, es ging um Anarchie, es ging um England. Später fügt er hinzu, dass die Wachowskis, wenn sie gegen die Vorgänge in den Vereinigten Staaten protestieren wollten, eine politische Erzählung hätten verwenden sollen, die sich direkt mit den Problemen der USA befasste, ähnlich wie dies Moore zuvor mit Großbritannien getan hatte. Der Film ändert wohl die ursprüngliche Botschaft, indem er jeden Hinweis auf tatsächlichen Anarchismus in den revolutionären Aktionen von V entfernt hat. Ein Interview mit dem Produzenten Joel Silver zeigt, dass er V aus den Comics als eindeutigen ""Superhelden ... einen maskierten Rächer"" identifiziert, der die Welt so einfach rettet, ""eine Vereinfachung, die Moores eigenen Aussagen über Vs Rolle in der Geschichte wiederspricht.  Co-Autor und Illustrator David Lloyd hingegen begrüßte die Adaption. In einem Interview mit Newsarama (eine amerikanische Website, auf der Neuigkeiten, Interviews und Essays über die amerikanische Comic-Industrie veröffentlicht werden) erklärt er:Es ist ein großartiger Film. Das Außergewöhnlichste daran war für mich, Szenen zu sehen, die ich mit der gleichen Sorgfalt und Wirkung in das Buch übersetzt hatte, um maximale Wirkung zu erzielen. Die ""Transformation""-Szene zwischen Natalie Portman und Hugo Weaving ist einfach großartig. Wenn Sie eine der Personen sind, die das Original so sehr lieben, dass Sie Abweichungen generell nicht tolerieren, können Sie den Film nicht mögen. Aber wenn Ihnen das Original gefallen hat und Sie eine Anpassung akzeptieren können, die sich vom Ausgangsmaterial unterscheidet aber genauso mächtig in ihrer Aussagekraft ist, dann werden Sie genauso beeindruckt sein wie ich.  Steve Moore (keine Beziehung zu Alan Moore) schrieb eine Romanisierung des Drehbuchs des Films, das 2006 veröffentlicht wurde. Entstehung zum Film Viele der Beteiligten an „V wie Vendetta“ arbeiteten bereits zuvor bei der „Matrix“-Trilogie zusammen. 1988 sicherte sich der Matrix-Produzent Joel Silver die Rechte an zwei Alan-Moore-Verfilmungen: „V wie Vendetta“ und „Watchmen“. Die Wachowski-Geschwister hatten bereits Mitte der 1990er ein Drehbuch für eine Verfilmung geschrieben. Während der Produktion von „Matrix Reloaded“ und „Matrix Revolutions“ überarbeiteten sie dieses und legten sich auf James McTeigue als Regisseur fest, da sie wenig Interesse daran hatten sofort nach der „Matrix“-Trilogie wieder Regie zu führen.Die Dreharbeiten begannen am 7. März 2005 im ebenfalls koproduzierenden Studio Babelsberg in der brandenburgischen Landeshauptstadt Potsdam. Innenaufnahmen entstanden dort zudem im ehemals kaiserlichen Schloss Babelsberg im gleichnamigen Park. Weitere Dreharbeiten fanden in der 1994 stillgelegten U-Bahn-Station Aldwych sowie am Palace of Westminster und am Big Ben statt. An den letzten beiden Drehorten durfte ausschließlich zwischen Mitternacht und 4.30 Uhr in der Nacht gedreht werden, wobei der Straßenverkehr maximal für vier Minuten stillgelegt werden durfte. Die Dreharbeiten sollten bis zum 8. Juni 2005 abgeschlossen werden, jedoch konnte dies aus produktionstechnischen Gründen nicht verwirklicht werden. So wurde der weltweite Filmstart vom 5. November 2005, dem Guy-Fawkes-Tag, auf den 16. März 2006 verlegt, darunter auch der Filmstart in Deutschland und der Schweiz. In Österreich sowie dem Vereinigten Königreich war der Film einen Tag später zu sehen. Vorab war der Film bereits am 11. Dezember 2005 in USA beim Austin Butt-Numb-A-Thon sowie bei den Internationalen Filmfestspielen in Berlin zu sehen. Das Budget des Films wurde auf 54 Millionen US-Dollar geschätzt. Am Eröffnungswochenende spielte der Film in den USA über 25,6 Millionen US-Dollar ein, im Vereinigten Königreich waren es knapp 1,2 Millionen Pfund Sterling. Die Gesamteinnahmen in den USA beliefen sich auf mehr als 70,5 Millionen US-Dollar, während im Vereinigten Königreich über 3,3 Millionen Pfund Sterling eingespielt wurden. Die weltweiten Einnahmen beliefen sich auf über 131,4 Millionen US-Dollar. An den deutschen Kinokassen wurden knapp 236.000 Zuschauer gezählt. In Deutschland wurde der Film am 9. März 2007 von Warner Home Video auf DVD mit einer FSK-16-Freigabe veröffentlicht. Die BluRay wurde später am 19. Juni 2008 veröffentlicht.Natalie Portman wurde bei der Besetzung der Rolle der Evey der Vorzug vor Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson und Bryce Dallas Howard gegeben. James Purefoy war der ursprüngliche Darsteller des maskierten Rächers, er stieg aber wegen künstlerischer Differenzen aus den bereits laufenden Dreharbeiten aus und wurde durch Hugo Weaving ersetzt. Die bereits mit Purefoy gedrehten Szenen wurden von Weaving nachsynchronisiert. Purefoy wollte nicht im gesamten Film die Maske tragen, während dies für die Wachowski-Geschwister ein entscheidender Punkt des Films war. Der Film ist Adrian Biddle gewidmet, dem Kameramann des Films, der am 7. Dezember 2005 an einem Herzinfarkt verstarbDer Film wurde von Joel Silver produziert, Regie führte James McTeigue, das Drehbuch stammt von den Wachowski-Geschwistern („Matrix“). Der weltweite Filmstart war der 16. März 2006. ""Ein Volk sollte keine Angst vor seiner Regierung haben. Eine Regierung sollte Angst vor ihrem Volk haben."" Unterschiede/Abweischung vom Comic Die Unterschiede/Abweischung vom Comic enthalten Spoiler zu dem Comic als auch zu Film.   -Bei einer Adaption von einem Medium zum anderen sind immer Veränderungen vonnöten. Auch bei V WIE VENDETTA ist das so. Das beginnt schon mit dem Jahr, in dem die Geschichte spielt. Im Comic sind es die 90er Jahre des vorigen Jahrhunderts, im Film wird die Geschichte in den Jahren zwischen 2028 und 2038 angesiedelt.-Eine subtile Veränderung ist, dass es in der Filmwelt Schwarze gibt. Man sieht sie in den Massenszenen. Im Comic ist das nicht der Fall, da wurden sie als “Feinde der Volksgemeinschaft” umgebracht.-Im Film ist es auch kein LSD-Trip, durch den Finch auf die Spur von V kommt. -Evey versucht nicht durch Prostitution Geld zu verdienen.-Der Anführer Adam Sutler ist im Film plakativer gestaltet. Er ist nicht ein asketischer Ordnungshüter, sondern von vornherein vom Größenwahn zerfressen.-Am Ende des Films werden Guy-Fawkes-Masken an das Volk ausgegeben. Im Comic ist das nicht so, dort ist es Evey, die in die Rolle von V schlüpft und sich öffentlich zeigt, um zu demonstrieren, dass V immer weiterleben wird.-Im Film wird V beim Ausbruch schwer von Feuer verbrannt und verunstaltet, während es im Comic möglich ist, dass er wie jeder normale Bürger aussieht. -Auch die Liebesbeziehung zwischen Evey und V kommt so nicht im Comic vor.-Evey wird im Film viel älter dargestellt als im Comic, da ist sie erst 16 Jahre alt. -V trägt in den Comics verschiedene Kostüme. Seine Maske ändert sich sogar.-V entfernt freiwillig seine Maske und zeigt Surridge sein Gesicht, bevor sie stirbt.-Im Comic wird die faschistische Regierung legal gewählt und durch die allgemeine Apathie der Öffentlichkeit an der Macht gehalten. Im Film ist es das ""St. Mary's Virus"", eine biologische Waffe, die von der Norsefire-Partei entwickelt und freigegeben wurde, um heimlich die Kontrolle über ihr eigenes Land zu erlangen.-Evey ist sehr naiv und nicht so selbstbewusst wie im Film. - Adam James Susan ist der Antagonist, im Film wurde dieser in Adam Sutler umbenannt. -Der Anführer der Norsefire Party ist Adam Susan. Er führt England mit eiserner Faust und mit Hilfe eines Supercomputers namens Fate, in den er heimlich verliebt ist.-Nachdem er Evey vor dem Fingerman gerettet hat, bringt er sie zurück zu seinem Versteck.- Lewis Prothero heißt in seiner Radiosendung ""The Voice of Fate"". Im Film ist es eine TV-Show wo er ""The Voice of London"" heißt. -V stoppt einen Zug mit Prothero und entführt ihn. Er ist verrückt nach einer Kombination aus einer Überdosis Batch-5-Drogen und dem Schock, seine wertvolle Puppensammlung in einer nachgebildeten Nachbildung von Camp Larkhill in Vs Hauptquartier verbrennen zu sehen. Er bleibt für den Rest der Geschichte handlungsunfähig.-Gordon ist ein Krimineller, der Evey versteckt und Sex mit ihr hat. Er wird von einem Gangster ermordet. Im Film ist er ihr Chef, schwul und hat eine Kopie des Korans.  -Wir schreiben das Jahr 1997 und die Welt hat unter dem Atomkrieg gelitten.-V wurde in Larkhill ein Medikament namens ""Batch 5"" verabreicht, das ihm überragende Kraft und Beweglichkeit verlieh.-Der Anführer Adam Susan wird während einer Parade von Rosemary Almond (kommt im Film nicht vor) ermordet.-Finch erschießt V, der in Eveys Armen stirbt.-Die Residenz des Premierministers ist das Ziel des Wikinger-Begräbnisses von V. Evey setzt seinen Körper mit Sprengstoff an Bord des Zuges. Sie übernimmt dann die Rolle von V und trägt sein Kostüm und seine Maske.-V ist im Film schon hart und ein Antiheld. Aber in den Comics ist er von Rachegelüsten zerfressen und macht auch vor Unschuldigen nicht halt. Man konnte sagen, im Film wird er etwas glorifiziert und heroischer dargestellt. Fun Facts/Unnützes Wissen Ich habe nicht alle Fun Facts/Unnützes Wissen hier eingetragen, da es auch einige gibt die wirklich unnütz sind.  -Der Graphic Novel wurde von Margaret Thatcher inspiriert. -Die Wachowski Schwestern (damals noch Brüder) schrieben das Drehbuch in den 90er und später bearbeiteten sie es erneut als sie noch an der “Matrix“ Trilogie arbeiteten.-Es wurde ein Großteil in Deutschland gedreht.-John Hurt, der den Kanzler Adam Sutler spielte, fand es ""seltsam"", mitten in Berlin eine Adolf-Hitler-Figur zu spielen, manchmal an Orten, an denen Hitler Reden hielt.-Es dauerte 200 Stunden, um die Dominos zu bauen.Vier professionelle Domino-Profis bereiteten die 22.000 Dominos in den Niederlanden vor dem zweitägigen Shooting vor.-Bei den Dreharbeiten zum Kampf auf der Victoria Station bewegten sich die beteiligten Stuntmänner buchstäblich in Zeitlupe am Set, während sich David Leitch, Hugo Weaving Stuntdouble, in Echtzeit bewegte. Das ließ ihn viel schneller als die Geheimpolizei von Fingermen erscheinen. Es wurde auch mit 60 fps aufgenommen, um die Fingermen noch mehr zu verlangsamen. -James Purefoy war ursprünglich als V besetzt und hat einige Szenen gedreht, die im Film enthalten sind, bevor er nach vierwöchiger Produktion durch Weaving ersetzt wurde. Weaving wurde über Purefoys schon gedrehten Szenen synchronisiert. -Scarlett Johansson, Keira Knightley und Bryce Dallas Howard wurden alle für die Rolle von Evey in Betracht gezogen. Die Filmemacher haben sich für Natalie Portman entschieden. Sie war großartig. Sie sagte sogar, sie freue sich darauf, ihren Kopf zu rasieren.-Im Film gibt es eine Dualität zwischen V und Evey. Wie zu Beginn des Films gezeigt, wurde V durch Feuer geschaffen (Laborfeuerszene), was im Gegensatz dazu später im Film Zerstörung und Rache bedeutet (Dach-Szene), Evey wird durch Wasser wiedergeboren, was Wiedergeburt und Vergebung bedeutet. Der Film endet mit Vs Tod, der das Ende von Leiden und Rache symbolisiert und Raum für Evey lässt.-Obwohl der Graphic Novel von Alan Moore geschrieben wurde, lehnte er jegliches Geld und jede Anerkennung für den Film ab, da er in der Vergangenheit negative Erfahrungen mit Adaptionen von “From Hell“ und “Die Liga der außergewöhnlichen Gentlemen“ gemacht hatte. Moore gab schließlich das gesamte Geld, das er erhalten hätte, an den Künstler weiter, der mit ihm an dem Comic gearbeitet hatte.-Wie bereits erwähnt, fühlte James Purefoy, dass die Maske seine Leistung beeinträchtigte. Das Gleiche geschah mit Weaving. Er konnte seine Stimme nicht so deutlich wie nötig projizieren. Während des Filmens sprach Weaving die Zeilen normal. In der Postproduktion ging er dann in ein Studio und wiederholte die Zeilen, damit sie synchronisiert werden konnten. Sogar einige der von Purefoy erwähnten Zeilen, die entfernt wurden, wurden mit Weaving Stimme überspielt.-In Valerie's (Natasha Wightman's) Rückblende gibt es eine kurze Szene, in der sie davon spricht, ihre Geliebten zu treffen, während sie ihren Film dreht. Die Filmcrew, die in dieser Szene auftrat, bestand fast ausschließlich aus den Crewmitgliedern für diesen Film.-Der Bericht über den Aufstieg von Adam Sutler (Sir John Hurt) an die Macht, den V (Hugo Weaving) Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) übergibt, entspricht in hohem Maße dem Bericht, den Leo Tolstoy über Napoléon Bonapartes Aufstieg an die Macht in Frankreich in Teil I, Kapitel III des Epilog zu Krieg und Frieden.-Natalie Portman arbeitete mit Barbara Berkery, der Dialektologin, die auch mit Gwyneth Paltrow zusammenarbeitete, um ihren Akzent zu perfektionieren.-Unter den Gemälden in Vs Versteck befinden sich Waterhouses ""The Lady of Shalott"", ""Puberty"" von Edvard Munch, ""Bacchus and Ariadne"" von Tizian, ""The Arnolfini Wedding"" von Van Eyck und ""Elohim Creating Adam"" von William Blake.-Die beiden auf dem Parliament Square eingesetzten Panzer waren echte Panzer der stillgelegten Armee. Jede Nacht, bevor die Fahrzeuge zum Schießstand transportiert wurden, wurde jeder Panzer vom staatlichen Sicherheitspersonal inspiziert, um sicherzustellen, dass die Waffen nicht funktionierten und in keiner Weise verändert worden waren. Sie wurden dann mit einem Lastwagen zum Ort gebracht, ohne dass während des Transports Zwischenstopps erlaubt waren, und sie wurden den gesamten Weg von bewaffneten Sicherheitsbeamten begleitet.-Die Handlung dieses Films ähnelt der Handlung von Alexandre Dumas 'Roman ""Der Graf von Monte Cristo"", da sich beide Geschichten um Charaktere drehen, die aus der Haft entkommen und sich an allen rächen, die für ihre Inhaftierung verantwortlich sind.-Das war Adrian Biddles (Kameramann) letzter Film. Er starb am 7. Dezember 2005 an einem Herzinfarkt. Dieser Film ist ihm gewidmet.-Als V auf Creedy trifft, sagt er ""Penny for the Guy"". Traditionell baten Kinder in England um Geld, um am 5. November, dem ""Guy Fawkes Day"", Feuerwerkskörper zu kaufen. An diesem Tag bauten die Kinder ein Mannequin von Guy Fawkes, um sie am Abend bei einem Feuer inmitten eines Feuerwerks zu verbrennen.-Auf dem Spiegel steht: ""Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici"" (""Durch die Kraft der Wahrheit habe ich, ein lebendiger Mann, das Universum erobert""). Das Wort ""Vniversum"" ist im Film und im Original-Comic als ""Veniversum"" falsch geschrieben.-Euan Blair, Sohn des ehemaligen Premierministers Tony Blair, arbeitete als Läufer für die Produktionsfirma dieses Films. Die Rolle stieß auf Kritik, nachdem Stephen Fry vermutete, dass politische Verbindungen die Erlaubnis zum Filmen in Regierungsgebäuden beeinträchtigten. Die Produzenten bestritten mit Nachdruck die Anschuldigungen. Der konservative Parlamentsabgeordnete David Davies sagte der Sunday Times: ""Es stinkt nach Heuchelei, dass Blairs Regierung bereit ist, eine Frau wegen eines einfachen Protests in Whitehall zu verhaften, aber glücklich ist, die Türen zu öffnen, wenn Blairs Sohn in einem Film auftaucht. Das heißt, das Parlament wird in die Luft gesprengt. ""-Eines der verbotenen Gegenstände in Gordons geheimem Keller ist ein Protestplakat mit einer gemischten Flagge aus den USA und Großbritannien mit einem Hakenkreuz und der Titel ""Koalition der Willenskraft"", der die ""Koalition der Willenskraft"" mit Friedrich Nietzsches Konzept kombiniert des Willens zur Macht.-Die Guy-Fawkes-Maske, die V in diesem Film trägt, tragen auch die Mitglieder der Computer-Hacking-Gruppe ""Anonymous"".-Natalie Portman untersuchte ihre Rolle, indem sie sich die Sam Green- und Bill Siegel-Dokumentation “The Weather Underground“ (2002) ansah und ""Faith and Treason"", Antonia Frasers Buch über Guy Fawkes, sowie die Autobiographie von Menachem Begin, Gründerin der Likud-Partei, las in Israel.-Natalie Portmans Kopfszene war in einer Einstellung erledigt. Regisseur James McTeigue verwendete drei Kameras für die Szene.-Wenn V liest und Evey ihre Hilfe anbietet, ist das Buch V ""The Golden Bough"" von Sir George James Frazer. Dieses äußerst einflussreiche Buch erregte Aufsehen, als es veröffentlicht wurde, da es die Religion empirisch als Mythologie, insbesondere die Mythologie Jesu, untersuchte.-Das Symbol der Norsefire Party ist ein altes Wappensymbol, das ""Croix de Lorraine"" genannt wird. Ein ähnliches Symbol wurde zwischen 1940 und 1944 als offizielles Symbol der Freien Französischen Streitkräfte von General Charles de Gaulle übernommen. Später wurde es für verschiedene gaullistische Parteien in Frankreich verwendet, insbesondere für die RP. (Kundgebung für die Republik).-Dieser Film hat viele Ähnlichkeiten mit George Orwells “1984“. Sir John Hurt spielte in seiner Verfilmung die Hauptrolle, spielte aber den Helden anstelle des Bösewichts (den er in diesem Film spielt).-Der Name Evey wird EV ausgesprochen, wobei E der fünfte Buchstabe des Alphabets ist, V fünf in Latein und Y der fünfundzwanzigste Buchstabe (5 im Quadrat).-In der Gedenkstätte für die an den Folgen des Virus Verstorbenen handelt es sich um Kinder, die ""Ring a Ring o 'Roses"" spielen. Es wird oft angenommen, dass der Kinderreim in Anlehnung an die Große Pest Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts entstanden ist.-Dieser Film sollte am 5. November pünktlich zum Guy Fawkes Day erscheinen. Aufgrund von Produktionsverzögerungen wurde es am Wochenende zum St. Patrick's Day veröffentlicht.-""Vi Veri Vniversum Vivus Vici"" wird Faust zugeschrieben, war aber tatsächlich ein Motto des berüchtigten Okkultisten Aleister Crowley.-Im ursprünglichen Comic heißt der Anführer Adam Susan und nicht Sutler. Er wurde umbenannt, weil ""Sutler"" Hitler ähnlich klingt.-Im Badezimmer von Lewis Prothero (Roger Allam) ist im Hintergrund eine Sammlung von Puppen zu sehen. Dies ist ein Hinweis auf den Comic, in dem Prothero eine wertvolle Sammlung von Puppen besaß.-Nachdem V Guy Fawkes-Masken an alle verschickt hat und die Unruhen beginnen, erwähnt der Fernsehsprecher, dass die ersten Unruhen in Brixton begannen. Dies ist ein Hinweis auf die Brixton-Unruhen von 1986 in London.-V trägt eine Vielzahl verschiedener Perücken in diesem Film, einige länger oder kürzer als andere, und sie behalten immer noch die gleiche Frisur bei.-Wenn V für Evey Eier kocht, summt er zu ""The Girl From Ipanema"".-V betritt ein Gebäude und wird von einer Wache herausgefordert. V öffnet seinen Mantel und enthüllt eine große Menge Sprengstoff, der an seiner Brust klebt. Die Wache flucht überrascht. Es gibt eine ähnliche Szene in “Matrix“ (1999), in der eine große Menge Waffen anstelle von Sprengstoff verwendet wird.  -Das Datum des 5. November, um das sich dieser Film dreht, war zufällig das Erscheinungsdatum von “Matrix Revolutions“ von Wachowskis (2003).-Es gibt zwei Hinweise auf die berüchtigte Punkrockband Sex Pistols, insbesondere die beiden in England verbotenen Songs ""God Save the Queen"" und ""Anarchy in the UK"". Die Gruppe wurde aus England verbannt, weil sie über Revolution und Anarchie sprach, zwei der Hauptpunkte dieses Films. Ihr Verbot kennzeichnete eine Ära der Zensur.-Vor den Dreharbeiten zu diesem Film studierte der Regisseur James McTeigue Gillo Pontecorvos “Schlacht um Algier“ (1966).-Am Ende, wenn die Leute ihre Masken entfernen, können Sie kurz Charaktere sehen, die im Film gestorben sind, einschließlich des Mädchens mit Brille, Deitrich und Valerie, die andeuten, dass ihre Sache und ihr Gedächtnis weiterleben.-Am Ende, wenn die Leute ihre Masken ablegen und die Explosion miterleben, sieht man Hugo Weaving selbst, der sein Gesicht zeigt. Es scheint, dass das Fernsehen doch sein Gesicht zeigt!-Body Count: dreiundsiebzig. ""Hinter dieser Maske ist nicht nur Fleisch, hinter dieser Maske steckt eine Idee! Und Ideen, Mister Creedy, sind kugelsicher!"" DVD und BluRay Cover Seien wir doch mal ehrlich, die deutschen DVD & BluRay Cover von „V wie Vendetta“ sind jetzt nicht wirklich der Hammer. Sie sind solide und erfüllen ihren Zweck. Aber die DVD & BluRay Cover aus den anderen Ländern sind da um einiges besser! Wer jetzt denkt, “Was interessieren mich die Cover von den Filmen (und Serien)?“ Tja, das Auge sieht ja bekanntermaßen auch mit und außerdem sehen gut gemachte Editionen im Regal einfach viel cooler aus als irgendwelche schlichten DVD & BluRay Hüllen!Ich will hier gar nicht alle Editionen die etwas anders sind hier auflisten, sondern nur die die ich für erwähnenswert halte, oder besser gesagt, die im Regal einfach cooler aussehen würden. - Mondo Steelbook (Blu Ray) von WARNER BROS. Studio.- Zavvi Steelbook (Blu Ray) aus UK - wird bei einigen Quellen als Frankreich Import angeboten. Was genau stimmt lässt sich nur schwer sagen. Da aber auf den Zavvi Seiten diese Fassung als Zavvi exklusiv angeboten wird, stütze ich mal darauf. - Zavvi Steelbook (Blu Ray) aus UK (noch eins?) JA! Diese Variante ist die Erstauflage von 2014 (die oben genannte ist von 2016). Mein persönlicher Favorit und Teil meiner Sammlung wo sie einen Sonderplatz hat! So viele sind es gar nicht und so nebenbei, alle die Varianten haben deutschen Ton(!) auch wenn es nicht bei allen in der Beschreibung angegeben wird.   Synchro – Deutsch und O-Ton Die deutsche Synchro übernahm die RC Production Kunze & Wunder GmbH & Co. KG in Berlin, die schon für die Synchros von “Matrix“, “The Dark Knight“, “Coraline“, “Codename U.N.C.L.E.“ und “Scott Pilgrim gegen den Rest der Welt“ oder “Departed“ verantwortlich waren. Die Übersetzung und das passende Dialogbuch übernahm Marius Clarén, den man auch als Stammsprecher von Jake Gyllenhaal und Tobey Maguire kennt. Die Dialogregie machte Tobias Meister, der ebenfalls einige Hollywood Größen spricht, wie etwa; Brad Pitt, Kiefer Sutherland, Tim Robbins, Gary Sinise und Sean Penn. Er hat sogar eine kleine Rolle in „V wie Vendetta“; die Überwachungseinheit 109 #1 (Grant Burgin).Manja Doering übernahm wie so oft Natalie Portman´s Part und auch die anderen Darsteller wurden mit passenden Stimmen belegt. Bekannte Stimmen hört man hier überall und die Synchro ist mehr als gelungen. Hugo Weaving der nicht wirklich einen Stammsprecher hat, außer man zählt Wolfgang Condrus (die Herr der Ringe Filme) und Hans-Jürgen Wolf (Matrix & Transformer Filme) die ihn schon mehrfach gesprochen haben dazu, wurde mit Oliver Stritzel besetzt. Es war zwar eine kleine Umgewöhnung, da aber Hugo Weaving stets hinter einer Maske agiert und man ihn nicht wirklich zu Angesicht sieht, fällt dies nicht negativ auf. Um ehrlich zu sein, Oliver Stritzel (Bruce Greenwood und Idris Elba) passt mit seiner markanten Stimme auch viel besser zu unserem brachialen “Helden“. Bevor hier Missverständnisse auf",,,,,,,

I have fond memories of a lot of the imagery in V for Vendetta, but remember literally nothing about the plot. To my surprise, it held up very well. The hyper stylized action is still cool as hell and while not directed by the Wachowski's, their influence is felt all over this film, to the point I'd believe they ghost directed it. While the action and overall plot is excellent, as is the excellent character in Hugo Weaving's revolutionary and iconic ""V"", the dialogue reeks of the same hokey pretentious crap that plagued The Matrix films. Although nowhere near to the extent, but there is a bit of self-important, pretentious lines that bring this down at times. This 1984 inspired take on a fascist England is also very well built, interesting and horrifying one, made even better by the fact it's run by John Hurt as an absolute monster. Natalie Portman also gives a very dedicated and strong role as the lead. Very glad I finally saw this again.

The few action scenes we get are just ok, but the overhyped “My Turn” scene was disappointing in its Snyder-esque execution.

I have to say the dystopian world featured in this film feels much closer to reality now than it did back then. Parts of it are positively uncanny - people relinquishing freedom for ""safety"", restriction of speech, media false reporting using fear driven propaganda and more. The story, which features an eloquent revolutionary opposing a tyrannical government, is full of interesting ideas mostly surrounding liberty and the relationship between people and government. As with the Wachowski's Matrix films; often the ideas overtake the drama. The small story is not as good as the overarching themes, so aspects of it can feel unsatisfying. The film does account for this with several hard hitting moments and revelations however. The way that the lead character's argument against totalitarianism unfolds on screen is fascinating and gives plenty to chew on. I think this is a film that might get more and more important as the years go on (if we let it). It will always remain an entertaining ride with a lot to say.",1,47,0,585,999,23-May-20,rated-8

There are a few ideals in there that I can't get behind. But as a film, as a piece of entertainment, I think V for Vendetta nails it. It's nice to look at, at times I would even call it dazzling- and agree with it or not, the film is structured well around its messages. There are moments of absorbing action (every time V fights) and even surprising sadness (V in Deliah's home). As the eponymous V, Hugo Weaving is astounding.

In a classic example of simply not being in the mood to watch something, way back in 2006 when my wife and I were newlyweds her friend decided it was a good time to visit which meant he would be sleeping on our couch for a number of days.  This didn't thrill me. When he arrived, he couldn't stop talking about the film he had recently fallen in love with called V for Vendetta and sure enough he had DVD in hand ready to give it a spin, show us this picture that dazzled him so. After twenty minutes, I was not even remotely dazzled and I decided to leave the room and call it a night, but looking back nothing about the film was at fault for this sour mood I was in. It was merely guilty by association. For all these years I have considered sitting down and giving this film a fair shake, but for whatever reason I just never did...until now, and by golly have I been dazzled. A stunning feature carried by amazing set pieces, an outstanding script by the Wachowski's, gorgeous cinematography and the confident and exciting directing by James McTeigue, it turns out V for Vendetta is the type of film that my cinematic soul finds endlessly accessible, the type of film that I could revisit a dozen more times over the next ten years and never get tired of it. Seems rather ironic, given how much I had avoided this film for nearly a decade thanks to the sour taste of a house guest. For shame, Shanderson. For shame. The beautiful Natalie Portman gives a solid performance and she is certainly well casted for the role, but Hugo Weaving steals the show despite never once showing his face from behind the V mask. What I found to be fascinating was just how much I could feel his shifts in demeanor despite the mask always maintaining the same eerie smile, and the tonal shifts we experience with V throughout always seem to work no matter how drastic they are, from flipping food in the kitchen while still behind the mask to the moments he spills the blood of those he deems worthy of his vengeance. V is scarred both literally and figuratively, and I cared for more about the character than I ever imagined I would.  V for Vendetta is an ass kicking, gorgeous delight of a film and I am saddened that I spent so much time associating it with a tiny, annoying period of time from my past. Life is far too short to hold grudges, especially against films that never did me wrong in the first place.",6,98,8,944,"3,338",16-Aug-14,rated-9

This pattern also charts across the procession of 4chan's favored meme directors, from the naive ""let's be hackers"" libertarianism of the Wachowskis to the cynical authoritarianism of Nolan, the superficial conservatism of Snyder and finally Phillips' recent attempt at seducing you back from the ideological fringes with Joker, back into the matrix of intersectional identity politics and liberalism, where every social stratum gets their own superhero movie as long as they stay in line, goddammit. V for Vendetta remains interesting in my estimation because it represents a transitional period for the internet's relationship with real life. Maybe you don't remember ""Project Chanology"" and maybe that's for the better, but it also follows this pattern, from its early phases as online hacktivist escapades towards nonviolent meatspace protests, where people who didn't know how to code could convene and collectively will the death of the CSI and its censorship practices, and everyone wore Guy Fawkes masks. Quaint, but also the prototype for every failed mass internet meetup since, from OWS to Fyrefest. There is no internet connection in V for Vendetta, only mass surveillance, but these things are fundamentally inseparable at this point. The film details its titular anonymous superhero's quest to subvert the totalitarian British state, and his relationship with the end-user, Natalie Portmanteau. Since V's release, mass surveillance programs like Facebook, Twitter, netizen sousveillance, and the resultant snitch and cancel cultures have increasingly replaced the church as the dominant moral office in the first world, which is perhaps our main overlap with Oceania. Maybe God and your ancestors aren't watching you masturbate, but Google and the government certainly are.  The most disappointing part of the movie is when, after watching the parliamentary building go up in pyrotechnics, everyone takes off their masks, mirroring everyone doing just that with the rise of social media and its protests. I sympathize with people who are brave enough to remove their masks in online interface, but what this film seems to understand is that anonymity is a kind of power. Depending on your political bias and sensitivity to shame, you might admit the last American presidential election to have been partly influenced by international ""trolls."" What the talking heads won't tell you is that the ""trolls"" were only powerful insofar as they were anonymous legionaries operating in targeted-advertisement cyberspace, where you and I are mere consumers, passively broadcasting which ideology and goods the algorithm can sell us with every click. Regardless, similar to how most war movies take place between 1939 and 1945, any interesting film about the internet moving forward will be spiritually located sometime at the turn of the millennium. Maybe now the internet can make you famous as quickly as it can make you fired, but it's only an elaboration of existing social networks that have been around for biological eons, like hierarchies based on physical attractiveness, charisma and industriousness, and has only resulted in your favorite president. It is no longer a brave new world where God himself might log in from the aether and troll us. It's much more pessimal now, and that megahurts.",6,37,1,375,567,23-Feb-20,rated-8

Still really enjoy it though.Hugo Weaving as V is definitely the stand out.He brings V to life. Natalie Portman as Evy is great as well. In terms of story it’s a 1984 story but with a happy ending. 1984 doesn’t exactly have a sad ending it has some hope but it’s definitely a depressing one.The plot is great.It’s a perfect build to that ending. The scene in the TV station is great as well.Also read 1984 one of my favorite books.Oh and I started reading Dracula today very good so far. And Crime and Punishment as well is extremely good. I highly recommend both. Crime and Punishment I started a couple of days ago but from what I read it’s just masterful writing.

A subversive freedom fighter who seeks to awaken a country's population to its governments crimes against its own people and the fascist state that it has become, this film asks serious questions of a fictional future England. An oppressed country ruled by fear, racism, and intolerance, it was only a matter of time before someone stood up to the dictator in charge played with conviction by John Hurt. Moore and Lloyd weave a decidedly intricate web here for director James McTeigue to run with, and run with it he does. Scripted by the Wachowski's, it's endlessly quotable, full of stunning set-pieces, with a fetching Natalie Portman, and a virtuoso performance from Hugo Weaving who stays behind the mask for the entirety of the film, this film has a style all of its own. We get heaps of stylized violence and a plot that captures the pure horror of a dystopian future society where lies, deceit, and ruthlessness are used as weapons to control a population. Visually stunning, colorful and sharp, this has a high-gloss comic book feel to it that heightens the enjoyment of an almost pantomime style anti-hero. Backed by the likes of Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, and Roger Allam, this does boast a cast that are up for something a little different from the ordinary, and both Fry and Allam are over-the-top in their respective roles.  Larger than life, just like the entire story, V quickly earns our respect for doing the right thing when others take the safety approach and pretend that all is well. Weaving was an inspired choice as V as he channels a mixture of psychotic anarchist and the Count Of Monte Cristo's anti-hero to stunning effect, you couldn't imagine anyone else playing him. One of the best graphic novel adaptations of recent years despite Moore disowning the film, only Sin City has come close to the originality shown here.",1,59,3,332,"3,882",9-Aug-14,rated-10

By pivoting an individual that effectively embodies the power and authority of the masses, this film achieves the grand scale its viewers desire and which does justice to the big issues it attempts to tackle. Although depicting an authoritarian police state version of Britain, ‘V for Vendetta’ almost never feels futuristic. As such, it becomes possible to compare the form of government in the film to the one reigning in reality, facilitating exaggerated blame to the latter and thus a more engaging look at the how our protagonist tries to dismantle the former. Played by a captivating Hugo Weaving and helped by an incredibly quotable script, that protagonist not only lifts the film from a cool action flick to one that is experienced as genuinely epic, but which will also last as an icon in cinematic history. ‘V for Vendetta’ is in the end a product of its zeitgeist, but by means of its huge entertainment value it has also contributed its own input to this spirit and not only in the form of a growing popularity in anonymous masks.

That the dictatorship shown was built on the ground of an epidemic shows how incredibly visionary Alan Moore was as the author of the comic and so the creative minds behind the film were. It is unbelievable how much some ""civilized"" states are moving in this direction. This current development gives ""V for Vendetta"" an almost uncanny depth and versatility that makes it necessary to watch again.It is difficult to grasp all the content-related details, ""V for Vendetta"" is dark brainpower with the charisma of ambivalence. The England of the future is a place where dictatorship rules. Book bans, curfews, total surveillance, media control, torture, experimental institutions that resemble concentration camps - total control, exercised by a few people, headed by Chancellor Adam Sutler. The past in a new edition, dictatorial mechanisms never gather dust.Is V a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Where is the limit? Indeed, right and wrong are blurred here in the philosophical substructure of an optical sadness. There is desolation in the walls and streets of London, the effects of oppression. Fear as a means of power, the people are paralyzed - only one tries to stand up to take the fear of the subjugated citizens. V uses the means of his opponents, at this point there is again the philosophical ambivalence. Violence sometimes also means justice - according to V also leads to freedom. Integrity through the pure sense of freedom - the end justifies the means. The result counts.No distinction is made between state and individual violence. This is about conflicts of interest. V expresses love with deprivation of fear, he wants to give people back freedom. The Chancellor tries to maintain his apparatus and plug gaps in the system. Control vs. Anarchy that leads to freedom. A fight by all means. Vigilante justice is the wrong term. Because there are no courts for the leaders of the system.An action naturally requires an equally strong counter-reaction. V sees himself as a monster created by the government. He sees himself as the only solution to the liberation of the people and England and also takes personal revenge on the side. There is a symbolic idea behind his plan to demolish parliament - but unless there are enough people behind a symbol, it is meaningless.Is the future a consequence of the past or do we experience a static cycle that repeats itself, ultimately in a power explosion that ends at zero hour? Anarchy as an urgently needed new beginning?“V for Vendetta” illuminates group behavior, the resulting dynamics and philosophizes about individuality. You can see a lot in this work. Critical time references in the direction of political events in America and Europe, the timeless relevance of philosophical questions - the film is like a good work of art that combines many facets and conveys superficial and profound beauty. Associations are awakened, doubts arise, thought processes flow.The cinematic harmony is right, the screenplay by the Wachowski brothers has intellectual substance and directorial debutant James McTeigue offers a courageous implementation.In the end a fire blazes, everyone takes off their masks, a symbol loses meaning because the people behind it emerge. Real action, deep inside. Pure ambivalence, with all its disreputable attractiveness. Remember, remember, the 5th of November!",1,86,5,493,572,5-Sep-20,rated-9

Vicariously scripted by the Wachowskis and valiantly directed by James McTeigue in what's his directorial debut, this vividly visualised voyage of a vigilante cast by vicissitudes of fate who veneers his visage with veil to vanquish virulent vermin of society and incites a revolution with vehicles of vengeance & violence is balanced in ways that most films of its genre never aspire to. Volatile yet vigilant from start to finish, the film benefits vastly from Hugo Weaving's viciously charismatic performance despite only utilising his vocals. And the veteran actor's verbalised act alone vouchsafes vials of vitality into his vindictive persona while his vacant vestiture compels us to view him as a vestige of the vox populi rather than an individual. Natalie Portman's input is as vinous as it is virtuous while John Hurt chips in with a volcanic rendition in his villainous role. The execution of various technical aspects is virtually faultless. Cinematography envelops the vistas with a bleak vibe & dismal tone to illustrate vanishing life under totalitarian rule while taut editing, variegated score & volant velocity make the experience all the more visceral. On an overall scale, V for Vendetta vibrantly blends the elements of cautionary tale, politically charged drama & action extravaganza into one visually stunning & thought-provoking cinema that provides a voice to the voiceless, and is a valid & vociferous reminder that every society is vested with the vim n vigour to dismantle any venal regime that vanguards vice and violates its volition.

Wasn’t particularly attached to the characters in any way, nor did I think the director brought a whole lot in terms of visuals and style, but where it shines is mainly through it’s script, world building and performances, as well as making V feel like a real person, it does a great job at humanizing him to a point where he feels tangible and palpable. Isn’t gonna be one that I feel like i’ll get much more out of after the fact, but it was fun in the moment.",1,23,0,"15,915","5,698",20-Aug-20,rated-8

A number of gags are smile worthy at best so the comedy element is limited however on the flip side the dramatic elements (lost jobs, no interviews, promotions and the general strain on life the job hunt can cause) don’t work either. There is limited weight to interactions between Miles Teller, Anna Kendrick and Bryan Cranston. It straddles a pretty wide border between familial feuding and broad humour. This contrasted against the uninteresting, “dude” humour focused job hunt narratives of Brandon T. Jackson, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Nicholas Braun lead for an unbalanced film which never sets itself a tone to maintain. It doesn’t nail any part of this. There are some nice moments such as Bryan Cranston getting the interview that are on the cusp of being funny but it’s played far too broadly to really be of any value. Miles Teller, Anna Kendrick and Bryan Cranston are the main focus of the film and I’ve rarely seen these three be so uncharismatic in a film. It really feels strained. The script by Kyle Penncamp and Scott Turpel is limited and I had tocheck it wasn’t directed by Miles Teller’s Will’s fictional production company. It also ends in the absolute worst way possible. The drama of the job scene all boiled down to Will basically saying “I don’t need to work for a company, I’m gunna start my own production company. Screw you guys, I hope this doesn’t make the film too redundant” and then he walks away and his voiceover actually says “Don’t just feel special be special.”Absolutely not having any of it. If that wasn’t bad enough, it feels way longer than it’s 80 minute run time. If this has ever given anyone hope on the job hunt please let me know, I’d be genuinely intrigued as to how.",1,3,0,67,75,28-May-18,rated-2

It is cocky, it puffs its chest out and it lets it incredibly talented cast (who share amazing chemistry FYI) cut-loose in a ridiculously basic look at Gen Y.

It’s called ‘Stressed Out’ by Twenty One Pilots, and at first it just had a catchy tune, but now I really feel like I can relate to the lyrics. Bear with me, this is going somewhere, I promise. The opening to Get a Job (2016) is perfect. It reminds us that when we were kids, everything was given to us, and we were praised for every tiny thing we did. Then, one day, at the end of our mandatory education, we’re thrown into the real world where no one cares about our small achievements, and we have to actually work for a living. That’s how I feel about life right now, or at least did a few years ago. I’ve found my feet now, thankfully. Back to that song, Stressed Out. There’s a particular line that give me same feeling as the opening to that movie: Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face,Saying, ""Wake up, you need to make money."" So, with a relevant and relatable plot, and a huge cast of some of my favourite actors and actresses, (Anna Kendrick, Alison Brie, Bryan Cranston, Miles Teller, Christopher Mintz-Plasse) I knew I couldn’t go wrong by giving this movie some of my time. Yeah. About that. Everything starts out perfectly fine. Will (Teller) and his girlfriend Jillian (Kendrick) are celebrating Jillian’s new job, which stirs up trouble in their relationship when Will is told he needs to step up. His father is fed up of financing him, and he needs to put his creative dreams aside and enter the corporate world. With an unusually short runtime of 1hr 23mins, this plot is plenty, especially when Jillian winds up losing her job and the roles get reversed, but so many sub plots are thrown into the mix that I couldn’t work out what was actually going on anymore. It’s a shame, because each plot in itself is absolutely fine. Will’s father loses his job, and has huge difficulty finding a new one because of his loyalty to his previous employer and his age. That’s a huge problem for the older generation right now, and could have tied in perfectly with Will’s story, given a longer runtime. But that’s not all. Each of Will’s friends has their own storyline of taking their first step on the career ladder, and that’s where it gets too messy. Whilst trying to desperately tie up the loose threads in the plot, it seems those responsible forgot to add in any jokes. The only comedic relief came from Alison Brie’s character who seemed to serve no purpose other than making sexual innuendos. She was funny, at least. So finally, after looking the movie up online to find out whether I was just being a miserable sod, I found out that Get a Job was made in 2012, and has sat on the shelf for the last 4 years, with Anna Kendrick herself confident that the movie would never get a release date.

Everything comes so contrivingly easy for the characters, who thankfully are hard not to like thanks to reasonably funny dialogue exchanges and chemistry from a pretty decent ensemble. The major pitfall of the film, one that is bound to rile female spectators, is the fact all female characters are either sexual deviants, or [SPOILERS AHEAD] in Anna Kendrick’s character’s case (who kinda disappears, which is crap), lands on hard times when fired from her job (which I’m pretty sure we never get told what it is), reveals she’s racked up debts, is reduced to spring cleaning the boys’ man cave, succumbing to smoking weed and playing Halo, and relying on Teller’s protagonist to “bring home the bacon”. Though, she does inspire Teller to sack off his newly appointed Vice President role in the ‘follow your dreams’ finale which disguises itself as a strong and active moment for her character, but considering during her rallying speech she declares her own lack of direction, and we never see her land on her feet professionally afterwards, this merely serves the purpose of liberating the male protagonist to fulfill his own ambitions. The film is very short, so perhaps an extra ten minutes would’ve been well spent focusing on the female ‘lead’, who one would assume judging by the posters, would have had a much more prominent and proactive role. Instead the writers waste a lot of time with Teller’s buddies’ subplots, instead of even starting one for the film’s biggest star. I did laugh quite a lot, to be fair, and enjoyed all of it. But since I was mostly drawn to this film for Kendrick, I’m left very disappointed by the injustices in the screenplay to her (and all the other female) character(s). This script could have done with some Carrie Fisher TLC!",4,5,0,243,"1,057",9-Jan-18,rated-5

Apparently, Get a Job was shelved for a total of five years and after it had just been released, it's understandable. Get a Job isn't exactly a film that is worth getting angry at, because even for how much many of the jokes simply don't land, there's just nothing even being committed. If I were to think of another film that just practically had no sort of aim, The Do-Over would come to mind but unlike said film, Get a Job doesn't feature some sort of an offensive excuse to shove in some sort of plot. All we are really being presented is a series of jokes failing to land one after another, somehow managing to sustain a running time of eighty two minutes, which it wastes shamelessly. There's not particularly all that much to talk about with Get a Job because you can already feel as if there's not really all that much effort being placed into what it is that we're left with. Throughout its own running time, the feeling that the people who worked on the film are not merely placing any effort whether it be from trying to stand out, or in a much bigger scenario, to even sustain the interest of anyone who will be watching. It only continues to move along, and after it ends, all that can be said to describe Get a Job is that it exists only because it just merely does, and with that, there's not so much of a point to back up the fact it's around. My best guess for the existence of Get a Job would come around from how it garners up some talents who would be recognized from their television work (Alison Brie from Community, Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad, John C. McGinley from Scrubs) and just hammers in their names. You can say the same for the main cast. whether it be Miles Teller or Anna Kendrick, because it's evident that none of the actors are even trying although we can recognize what talent they were able to show in everything else that wasn't this, a stunning lack of all of that is present in here. When I just look at how talented some of these actors are, the only thing that kept on running through my head was a simple question, ""Why did any of these people choose to be in this?"" None of the comedy ever really lands, but it's not anything noteworthy in an offensive manner. Some scenes may garner a chuckle or two, but even with that said nothing really stands because it's not even trying at all to be any different. Unfortunately, just the matters which they show from time to time sink a harmless film even more when the jokes can come off as more awkward or gross than the rest (you have a scene in which Bryan Cranston has to give Miles Teller some urine in order to pass a job interview, and there's another scene that involves drinking deer sperm). Considering how gross some of these jokes can get, they are never overplayed which is somewhat of a good thing, at least when compared to the absolutely classless Grimsby. One guess that I made from the fact we have some popular television stars in the film would have been that Get a Job was originally intended as a television pilot only extended for the sake of making it a film in order to get everything out there after an unsuccessful pitch, because the effort put behind it certainly doesn't feel like it was something attempted for the big screen. It feels very much like a failed television pilot at best, many lame jokes coming in one after the other, only carrying on for a few more episodes because we tune in from how we recognize actors and actresses that we have enjoyed in something else. Get a Job manages to succeed in reminding us about how time could be better used watching these talents we like, for it never offers really anything that will have it stand out from anything. A score this low should normally incite much more vitriol, but I won't lie when I say that I enjoy seeing some of these actors at least trying not to phone in. I could never get really angry with Get a Job because it never did anything that would incite such rage coming from myself, since it was really just offering nothing in the slightest to either get angry with nor get overly entertained with. Get a Job just feels so distinctively effortless in many regards, as there's never a sense that it knows what it wants to be, whether it be a drama or a comedy so suddenly, the blend just fails to convince. It's already rather easy to see why it had been shelved, for all that we're really getting is nothing more than a movie that's merely just there.",6,15,4,"1,347","6,791",11-Apr-16,rated-3

It is quite embarrassing to see that Bryan Cranston, who has carved a niche for himself, is not only hammering in his not so cool father role, but also he shows how badly he can perform.

I feel like I need a participation trophy just for watching. The star is for the cast in general and specifically watching Anna Kendrick pull on a bong that's bigger than her.

Get a Job has a Miles Teller Pain and Suffering Index (MTPSI) score of approximately 1.5. I think he gets head-locked? I can't be bothered checking. It's mostly emotional pain from being unemployed.

The script is utterly appalling and I don't think anyone really knew how they ended up there. It feels like a really shitty sketch that was just left to ramble, and is shot like an episode of Zoey 101 (I love Zoey 101, but it shouldn't bleed into any other creative entity).

Dylan Kidd instead of going for a drama with little hints of comedy went the complete opposite route and went for a comedy with little hints of drama and thats this films biggest mistake.This film has a pretty good cast, that being Brian Cranston, Miles Teller and Anna Kendrick. Miles Teller was in 'Whiplash' and as far as im concerned, that film is a Masterpiece, Brian Cranston was in arguably the best show of all time 'Breaking Bad' and Anna Kendrick has been in many good to great things (End of Watch, The Accountant, A Simple Favor). So this film should've been really good but its just not. Anna Kendrick is the standout cuz i dont think she's given 1 bad performance. Miles Teller to my disappointment wasn't GREAT in this. I fear he might be a 1 trick pony. I hope not, he definitely has acouple more phenomenal performances up his sleeve, he needs to pick better projects. And Brian Cranston....what the hell man. I dont know why he picked this role. Maybe hes having trouble finding work which i highly doubt. Hes just not good in this and i fully believe its the script and directors fault. Lets talk about Dylan Kidd for a second. This guy is tarnishing the Dylan Name. He's just NOT a good director. I haven't seen his other 2 films and i don't plan to. Never heard of this guy before and i now know why. This film just isnt good in the slightest. It DOES have some things i liked to an extent. The friend that got a job as a school teacher, then a gym teacher. The stuff with him is pretty good, again, to an extent. The stuff to make a good basketball subplot/film is there but Dylan completely drops it and seems to forget about it.Anna Kendrick is the best thing about this film. She actually gives a good performance, again, to my knowledge she hasnt given 1 bad performance.There ARE some things directing wise that kinda bring her performance down but as a whole, she did pretty good.And lastly, i like the song that plays when the film ends. The lyrics if you know you are the best of them, going all out like the champions,You're gonna have to man up nowYou're gonna have to man up now Those lyrics are actually kinda inspiring unlike this film. The song as a whole is a mess but those lyrics are pretty good in my opinion. I went into this film wanting an inspiring story about a guy trying to find a job but instead got this. I'm in the situation of trying to find work. Its hard trying to find a job with extreme anxiety, OCD, ADD, and depression. Again, i wanted something to get me out of the dumps but this film just didnt do that. Its a mess of a film and completely hollow.  Im giving 'Get A Job'1 out of 5 stars.

The film, with its robust mix of naughty and nice, smart and silly comedy, is an uptempo, often hilarious piece of work with enough spiked-nog kick to make it stand-out. Revolving around a holiday mixer that grows into gargantuan proportions when a tech company finds itself needing  to impress a client, ""Office Christmas Party"" observes the party to end them all. Crazed acts, economic Grinchiness, minor mistletoe romance, and an epic drive through the film's urban environs inject the what-can-go-wrong-will comedy with potent and engaging flair.  Gordon and Speck capitalize on their cast and textured, personality-rich comedy to fuel the film. Jason Bateman is his usual wry everyman, Jennifer Aniston is a solid nouveau Scrooge, and TJ Miller is a spritely Santa. Buffering the leads are the dynamically placed Olivia Munn, Kate McKinnon, and Vanessa Bayer. The cast, performing against a burnished, wintry landscape, easily handles the film's combination of goofy, witty, and physical comedy.  There is a robustly amusing flavor and a go-for-broke comic spirit that makes ""Office Christmas Party"" work.

Because I know I will never have an epic party experience in my own life because I a) don't drink and b) can't recreate slow motion dance moves scored by Drake, I rather watch attractive actors and the magic of editing supply me with this artifice. Take Me Home Tonight is my favorite movie of all time because it allows me to experience a bomb ass party with Chris Pratt and cocaine while also being set in the 80's, something that I can never achieve. 2015 provide us with two dope ragers with the ""surprise this whole movie is a party"" enjoyment of Sisters and the Seth Rogen Holiday Special that is The Night Before. OCP is trying its hardest to be a combination of the two and misses the mark at every turn whether it's being funny, sentimental or seasonal. Though it opens strong, it's not able to immerse me in the wild night experience or cinematically conveys it of being as great as promised. Like the start of every movie before we can get to the juicy main event, we begin with the introduction in this case to our lead, sad sack Josh (Jason Bateman) who has just finalized his divorce. Bateman plays his usual smart alec, straight man persona which if you're me you'll take it but I realize others would be happy to leave it. Things ramp up once we get the grand introduction to the many characters that make up the titular office. Everyone gets their moment to shine up top and establish what larger than life personality they are, highlights being the uptight head of HR Mary (Kate McKinnon), struggling single mother Allison (Vanessa Bayer) and baller rich man-child Clay (TJ Miller) who runs the Chicago branch of the software business passed down by his father. Jennifer Aniston busts in as boss ass bitch Carol, Clay's sister and threatens to shut down the branch if they don't land a major deal by the next day. The believable sibling rivalry is a nice added touch to the archetype of Scrooge CEO who wants to ruin everyone's Christmas. As a not festive person myself who also is physically strong and respects someone who doesn't put up with shit, Aniston ruled and characters like her are crucial when Bateman and romantic interest/hacker Tracey (Olivia Munn) are so vanilla. What a wild night of debauchery and mishaps should be is hilarious and so outrageous and exciting that you wish you could be there. The lead up is for sure fun with boardroom bickering between Clay and Carol then the party planning montage which includes Clay exhausting his contacts to try to invite Kanye (sadly no pay off on that). Laughs became fewer and far between as the lame employees get turnt on cocaine and egg nog. This is due to as the film progresses it becomes increasingly plot heavy, adding on more road blocks and caveats to the ""save the company"" storyline. Half the characters are too side tracked to even be at the party and we're stuck watching random extras photocopy their butts. Sisters really exceeded at this grandiose party with the overflowing bubbly washing machine, drugged Bobby Moynihan doing Scarface impressions and bad yet brilliant choreography by Fey and Poehler. There's nothing unique about this party and the raunchy dick jokes fall flaccid. The B plot that takes over the third act which includes 22 Jump Street stand out Jillian Bell as a pimp who takes Clay hostage, sounds amazing based on the talent alone but the script gets too involved with its action set pieces. By the end, the movie has thrown so much at you that it incorrectly assumes that we care an ounce about the imperative technical solution to saving this company. For a movie so confidently stating its premise, it finds so many ways to stray to the far reaches of the city so they don't have to be at said party. As much as I've just trampled over OCP I'll at least say it's trying. There is diversity in both race and gender, often something you'd be hard pressed to find in the straight white man dominated narratives of big budget comedies. As much as the jokes are crass, at least they're not racist which I realize is a low bar I'm setting but case in point Dirty Grandpa. There's an attempt at progressive female characters with the pimp gender swap and Tracey being the mastermind of the finale but still Carol is the stereotypically ""cunty"" female boss and the stale bit of a nerd hiring a prostitute as his fake girlfriend gives Neon Demon's Abbey Lee little to work with. Even with its mini-strides Office Christmas Party fails at its attempted purpose, it is neither a new holiday classic nor a raucous hour and a half that I want to get on up in. I'm not saying it would be more time to go to an actual office Christmas party but at least there would be cake.",4,9,0,659,805,11-Dec-16,rated-5

In my experience, when confronted with cinematic perfection, you just know. You know when you know, y'know? It's speechless, it's a sensation that leaves your mouth agape. But the posed question comes with many interpretations dependant on who you ask. Some people look for formalism and a rich textural style and sense of creation. Others look for something more personal and emotionally investing.  So what makes Office Christmas Party - this raunchy, festive comedy - my pick for the greatest movie of all time? Simple - it's not Bad Santa 2. Which is another way of me saying it's not the worst movie of all time. So if it's not the worst movie of all time, logic must dictate it's therefore most certainly in the running for best movie of all time. I don't think that's how logic works but it's what I'm going with.  This movie is Citizen Kane x My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by way of Michelangelo... at least in comparison to Bad Santa 2.

Office Christmas Party does bring those things, but there’s sadly nothing else good in this film. Or well, Kate McKinnon is funny and there’s an ounce of character dynamics but it’s so wasted on a plot just wanting to create easy jokes. None of the jokes are born naturally from character-interactions and instead comes of as incredibly forced and whilst I’m certainly not prude, so many jokes focusing just on cramming in curse-words does get repetitive.

It's obvious the cast had a lot of fun while shooting the movie and their fun rubs off on the audience. McKinnon is unsurprisingly the MVP, but Karan Soni continues his excellent year by stealing the show despite still being unrecognizable for most of the general audience. Really though, most of the cast doesn't disappoint thanks to their excellent chemistry with each other. (Rob Corddry's character doesn't work at all though.) The jokes are hit and miss, and it's clear that most of the film was improv, but it's just really enjoyable to watch these great comic actors play off each other. It all leads to a bombastic (although more generic than the rest of an already highly unoriginal movie) ending that just feels right thanks to its magical Christmas feeling. Office Christmas Party is an enjoyable way to spend two hours, although it probably won't stick with you for that much longer afterwards.

I really wanted to wait until Christmas to see this, but alas, I was having a Kate McKinnon movie marathon on Sunday.

Situations were ramped up and I have to say that seemed like a totally insane Christmas Party. Some of the characters were funny and the brother and sister wrestling on the floor was memorable.

It's little surprise then that it has received mostly negative reviews but I do think that the tone of some of them has done the film a disservice because, for all its faults, this isn't an embarrassingly bad movie, it's just a somewhat uneven one. Overall, the feeling I had throughout my viewing experience was goodwill - I wanted it to pick up, I wanted it to find its feet - and a lot of that was down to the excellent cast. Now granted, Jason Bateman is essentially playing the same role he's played in virtually everything, but he still has - to me, at least - enough likeability to get a free pass, whilst Jennifer Aniston represents the film's Scrooge, and it's amusing to see Rachel be mean to a little girl and wipe the floor with some pimp's hulking heavies. As with Ghostbusters though, it is Kate McKinnon who steals the whole movie by seemingly working to a completely different script to everyone else around her. As Mary, the demented, workaholic HR lady who gradually reveals her wild eccentricities as the night progresses, she's on incredible form and I just had to see her wink at TJ Miller in one of the early boardroom scenes to be up for whatever came along and thankfully all of her stuff hits the spot and finds your funny bone. Also on fine form is the gorgeous Olivia Munn, trading off some of that half geek/half goddess characterisation she developed on TV's The Newsroom, but I was really pleased and surprised to see some good characterisation in the film's smaller, supporting roles, most notably in single mom and the glue that holds the office together Allison played by Vanessa Bayer. But the script definitely needed one more draft to pull all these promising aspects together to produce the film this really ought to have been.

The film, with its robust mix of naughty and nice, smart and silly comedy, is an uptempo, often hilarious piece of work with enough spiked-nog kick to make it stand-out. Revolving around a holiday mixer that grows into gargantuan proportions when a tech company finds itself needing  to impress a client, ""Office Christmas Party"" observes the party to end them all. Crazed acts, economic Grinchiness, minor mistletoe romance, and an epic drive through the film's urban environs inject the what-can-go-wrong-will comedy with potent and engaging flair.  Gordon and Speck capitalize on their cast and textured, personality-rich comedy to fuel the film. Jason Bateman is his usual wry everyman, Jennifer Aniston is a solid nouveau Scrooge, and TJ Miller is a spritely Santa. Buffering the leads are the dynamically placed Olivia Munn, Kate McKinnon, and Vanessa Bayer. The cast, performing against a burnished, wintry landscape, easily handles the film's combination of goofy, witty, and physical comedy.  There is a robustly amusing flavor and a go-for-broke comic spirit that makes ""Office Christmas Party"" work.

Simply because of the cast assembled, that includes, T.J Miller, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Anniston, Olivia Munn and Kate McKinnon. And fact that I expected a dull, vulgar comedy with no real characters. The aspects of the film that impressed me were creativity. It was great to see a Christmas movie that cleverly integrated a celebration that is embraced by ample companies across the world and turn it into a horrible disaster. I thought the actors were a suitable choice and acclimatized into their roles well even while it corroborates some actors as being stereotypical. offices of a Chicago tech company is looking to throw a rollicking Christmas party to end the year. Zenotek's proverbial humbug Carol Vanstone (Aniston) would rather close down the branch before the New Year and poach all valuable employees. Clay Vanstone (Miller); Branch manager, brother of the CEO and archetypal man-child - would rather that didn't happen and uses the party to impress a potential client (Vance). There are moments of a hilarious script and there are moments of same old comedy film script. While much of the story beats and stakes are pinned on Zenotek's sibling rivalry, the technical leads are Chief Technical Officer Josh Parker (Bateman) and Head of Tech Tracey Hughes (Munn) who is so comfortably in their wheelhouse that they hardly need mentioning. Generally speaking the movie is very entertaining, and doesn't take itself seriously, it is a good movie to watch to on a Friday night after a long week in the office, but only to the people who are into this movie genre. Keeping this one short because of it ain't movie you really watch to view the “oohs” and “aahs” its one of those that just entertains you for time being and disappears into the yearly watched film still personally I am into this kind of genre and I loved it.

Could have been shorter and some of the character arcs feel like they could have been cut (I do actually like the Nate/Stripper subplot though, don't judge me) but overall it is what its is, a fun distraction with a talented cast.Speaking of cast, on a more serious note, its a shame TJ Miller turned out the way he did. He's pretty good in this and adds a nice goofy charm to his character, and I used to really like seeing him in movies before the fake bomb call went down. It always hurts when it turns out someone you look up to (for me Jason Lei Howden and Doug Walker) turns out to be a danger towards the people around them who desperately needs to change. I get that these actors/directors are still people after all, and people make mistakes, but when you find out that the people who inspired your writing style, the people who you always looked forward to seeing, the people who made you feel like you're not alone, turn out to be broken beyond repair, that fucking hurts.",1,19,0,"2,861","1,668",21-Jul-20,rated-6

The Last Jedi is in fact a VERY good film. My biggest gripe with the movie initially was it bored me. First watch the first half really took me out of the movie and I was never able to get back into it. Upon second watch, that wasn’t the case. It flowed much better this time around. The movie felt completely natural, where as the first time I found it very jarring. Initially, I wasn't a fan of Rey's parents being nobodies. But the fact they are nobodies makes Rey an even better character. Despite her upbringing she was able to make something of herself and escape the same fate as her parents. Just because your parents aren't doctors or lawyers doesn't mean you can't grow up to be one. We are responsible for making our own success. Obviously some people are better set up for success because of their upbringing. But Rey was not, she was the ultimate rags to riches story. I mean her parents were alleged drunks and they abandoned her in a junkyard. Now she's a badass Jedi. How's that for a success story? It would have been nice to know more about Snoke, but he is a major presence on screen. Andy Serkis killed it! Snoke is legitimately scary. Whenever he was on screen, I actually felt uncomfortable. Even though he's a fragile, disfigured person the evil just seeps through him. I just wish he wasn't killed off, it would have been awesome to see him play a role like The Emperor. I understand why he was killed off; I was just left wanting more Snoke. The whole scene of his death is so fucking cool though. Rey and Kylo tearing through the Red Guards is dope as fucking shit. It's definitely one of the best fight scenes in Star Wars history.  Carrie Fisher is the glue that holds this whole film together. May she rest in peace. I still think he floating through space in really lame. I like the fact that she has the force, I just don't like how it came into fruition . Yes, Jedi are powerful but are they powerful enough to survive a massive explosion and being out in space? I don't think so.  I'm still not crazy about the direction they went with Luke's character. At the same time I understand it. Hell, he's old now and he's seen a lot of shit over the years. In that sense him being over and done with the Jedi is understandable. My man is old and he just wants peace and quiet. He gets totally redeemed at the end though. His sendoff/last stand is so awesome. The Finn and Rose subplot is still pretty lame. It certainly didn't bother me as much this time around. I do feel really bad for the actress who played Rose. People are being really nasty and hateful online towards her character. She's a really sweet and innocent character, comparing her to Jar Jar Binks is flat out ridiculous. Stop that shit. She says one of the best lines in Star Wars history, ""That's how we're gonna win. Not fighting what we hate, saving what we love."" That is an incredibly powerful statement and I teared up a little bit when she said that. Originally, I was mad she rescued Finn. But the line she says really sunk in with me this time and made me realize she's absolutely right. Rose, you go girl! I think my original lukewarmness towards the film rooted from me being bored. Since I was bored all the little nitpicky things bothered and annoyed me. Second watch many of the nitpicks I had didn't bother me anymore. I just sat back and let these changes happen and even came to appreciate a lot of them. The Last Jedi is not a perfect film, there are still issues I have with the movie. Rian Johnson deserves major props for not taking the safe route and not being afraid to break the ""rules"". I loved The Force Awakens because it brought me back to why I love Star Wars so much. I really really like The Last Jedi because it dared to be something different.  (More to come.

(""you're not alone. neither are you."") the film itself is rather clumsy, strangely-structured and messily lurches from sequence to sequence but instead of doing so out of flat, corporate-mandated exposition, it does so out of a bleeding heart for its characters who themselves are wrestling with imperfection. with realities that don't conform to the images they've imagined, the ones we've been shown before. (shoutout to how this manifests even in the action, driver's lumbering physicality while swinging a lightsaber is some of the most beautifully awkward choreography in all of mainstream cinema.) it's important that no arc here is a straight path but a series of failed plans and seemingly inconsequential detours that build to a collective of actions by people just trying their best with the feelings and histories that inform them. hamill delivers maybe my favourite performance of the series as jaded, nihilistic professor luke, taking the once optimistic liberal war hero and weighing him down with decades of personal and political failure (an idea lucas himself was interested in if the depiction of jedi and institutions in the prequels are any indication), the ""shame and consequence"" of a single moment of weakness. it's a complex depiction of fear and regret and the closest this series has gotten to Empire Strikes Back's moving exploration of the bad decisions and pain we're willing to endure for our friends. as badly and righteously as you might want to the past cannot be killed, you can burn it to the ground but you'll still have to carry it with you and eventually pass it on. a battlefield bleeds red but it all comes back to kids and stories... ""only in dreams."" RIP to the next person who tries to sneakily fit idiosyncratic images and genuinely interesting character work into one of these.",1,867,22,475,"19,685",20-Dec-19,rated-10

Das ist der Versuch etwas zu verarbeiten, was nur sehr schwer zu verarbeiten ist. Der Versuch, den kontroversesten Star Wars-Film auseinanderzunehmen und ihn wieder zusammenzusetzen. SCHWER ZU VERARBEITENDass The Last Jedi so schwer zu verarbeiten ist, liegt auch am Thema: Star Wars war schon immer Star Wars - was auch immer das bedeutet. Doch zumindest haben wir seit über 40 Jahren eine grobe Vorstellung davon, was das für uns bedeutet. Was die Magie von Star Wars für jeden persönlich ausmacht. Wie sehr unsere Kindheit, unsere Nostalgie, unser Interesse für dieses Universum, - unsere individuelle Erfahrung - Star Wars für jeden einzelnen etwas anders definiert.Ich persönlich war noch nie so durcheinander nach einem Screening. Noch nie ist meine Erwartungshaltung von einem Film mit dem Endergebnis so sehr kollidiert. Prinzipiell wird der Faktor “Erwartungshaltung” doch überbewertet. Landet ein Film hinter den eigenen Erwartungen, genügt er eben auch dem eigenen Anspruch nicht - egal ob es die Inszenierung oder die Story ist. Übertrifft ein Film die eigene Erwartung, ist das umso besser. Ganz anders verhält es sich eben mit The Last Jedi. Hier geht es nicht um den filmischen Anspruch, sondern um den an ein ganzes Universum. Bewiesen haben das sogar ausgerechnet die umstrittenen Prequels: inszenatorisch teilweise katastrophal und inszenatorisch teilweise genial - aber so oder so einfach mehr von einer Welt, in die man eintauchen möchte. Man ist strapazierfähig und am Ende vielleicht sogar noch dankbar dafür. DAS UNERWARTETEThe Last Jedi macht das von Anfang an anders - wortwörtlich anders. Lukes Reaktion auf Rey steht symbolisch für alles, was Autor und Regisseur Rian Johnson mit dem Film und seinen Figuren macht. Es ist komplett unerwartet, geradezu unvorhersehbar, entmystifiziert das eigentliche Ende und die emotionale Tragweite von dem Film davor, streut sogar noch einen Witz ein - und ist damit all das, wofür man diesen Film hassen sollte, aber eben auch all das, wofür man ihn lieben kann. Johnson schlägt hier von Anfang an eine komplett andere Marschrichtung ein, als man es erwartet hätte - als man es vielleicht sogar gewollt hätte. Die Pointe ist aber kein billiger Witz auf Kosten seiner Figur, sondern stellvertretend für die Charakterentwicklung, die Luke seit seinem Bruch mit Kylo Ren genommen hat. Johnson dachte sich etwas dabei, auch wenn das bedeutet, dass er viele Fans und ihre Vorstellung von Luke damit komplett vor den Kopf stößt. Und zu diesen Fans gehört auch Mark Hamill selbst. Er las das Skript und sagte offen zu Johnson, dass er mit jeder einzelnen von dessen Entscheidungen für Luke nicht einverstanden sei. DER ANDERE LUKEDas ist die Krux an The Last Jedi: Johnson traf Entscheidungen, die vielen Fans sauer aufstoßen, seiner Hauptfigur sauer aufstoßen und noch nicht einmal ihm selbst leicht fallen. Und das ist wiederum sein Trumpf: Johnson tat das, weil es für seine Geschichte das Beste ist. Es spiegelt das Dilemma wider, in dem sich einst Michael Arndt befand: Der Oscar-Preisträger war der unrühmliche erste und alleinige Drehbuchautor von The Force Awakens und scheiterte an zwei Dingen. Erstens am umfangreichen, aber auch völlig überladenen und widersprüchlichen Expanded Universe. Eine neue Geschichte mit den alten Charakteren konnte so nicht darin stattfinden. In der Folge übernahmen für ihn Regisseur J.J. Abrams und Star Wars-Veteran Lawrence Kasdan. Sie verwarfen das alte Expanded Universe und fingen von vorne an. Der zweite Grund für Arndts Scheitern ist Luke Skywalker. Arndt verzweifelte an der Legende Skywalker. Wann immer dieser den Raum betrat, stahl er allen anderen die Show. Skywalker war eine Figur, die nicht mehr zu entwickeln war und der Entwicklung der anderen Figuren im Weg stand. Johnson macht aus dieser Legende eine gescheiterte Legende. Eine Legende, die erst zu ihrer eigenen Katharsis finden muss, um wieder andere inspirieren zu können. Und das bereitet Johnson sorgfältig vor. Jedes Wort, jede Tat, spielt später wieder eine Rolle. Nichts geschieht zufällig. Alles wird vorbereitet. STRUKTURELLES UNGLEICHGEWICHTIn dem was Johnson erzählt und wie er es erzählt, handelt er fundamental anders als die Filme vor ihm. Abrams und Kasdan strickten in kürzester Zeit  einen Film zusammen, der strukturell und inszenatorisch schon zu sehr an die größeren Vorbilder angelehnt ist und reicherten es an mit frischen Charakteren und - typisch Abrams - mehr Mystery, als sie vielleicht jemals hätten auflösen können. George Lucas hatte gegen Ende am liebsten sich selbst zitiert, dafür aber auch wenigstens eine komplett neue Geschichte erzählt, wenn auch überraschungsarm und offensichtlich ohne die eigenen Filme genau genug gesehen zu haben. Rian Johnson geht seinen eigenen Weg - auch wieder im Guten, wie im Schlechten. Im Guten, weil die Gesamtstruktur des Filmes so anders und damit so unvorhersehbar anders ist, als in sämtlichen Inkarnationen davor. Im Schlechten, weil die Struktur im bisher längsten Star Wars-Film mitunter auch die zäheste ist. Inszenatorisch erschafft Johnson Momente, die zum Besten gehören, was Star Wars zu bieten hat - die das Publikum den Atem anhalten lassen, die nicht nur schön anzusehen sind, sondern einen lange vorbereiteten Klimax in unvergessliche Bilder packen. Momente für die Ewigkeit. Inszenatorisch erschafft Johnson aber auch Momente, die einen die Augen verdrehen lassen. Momente, die andere schon besser lösten. Momente, die trotz aller Herleitung und Aussage, so deplatziert wirken, dass sie einen aus dem Film reißen können. Gerade weil dieses Unvorhersehbare so nicht zu Star Wars gehörte und genau deswegen so unvorhersehbar ist. Bis jetzt, denn Johnson macht es zu Star Wars und das ist auch ein Problem. KUNST UND KÜNSTLEREin Problem, das aber schneller als man denkt gar keines mehr ist, hat man sich erst einmal an diese neue Erzählweise gewöhnt. Selten hatte ein Film beim zweiten Mal mehr zu gewinnen, als The Last Jedi. Das liegt aber nicht nur an der dann leichteren Verdaulichkeit beim zweiten Anlauf, sondern an der Intelligenz des Filmes. Er hat seine schwierigen Passagen, aber nochmal: Nichts geschieht zufällig. Alles hat einen Grund. Man nehme nur den Ausflug nach Canto Bight. Er entschleunigt den Film, bringt seine Figuren nicht wirklich weiter, hätte dramaturgisch komplett umschifft und/oder anders aufgelöst werden können. Er verschwendet sogar Benicio Del Toro. Andererseits ist der Ausflug essentiell für die eigentliche Aussage des Filmes. Sein Ende funktioniert nur wegen diesem Ausflug. Als Johnson den 3-Stunden-Rohschnitt auf 2½ Stunden straffte, konnte er unmöglich auf diesen Ausflug verzichten. Um die Tragweite des galaktischen Konflikts zu transportieren hat einst Lucas selbst bei seinen eigenen Filmen nachträglich noch Hand angelegt und sie um genau so etwas erweitert. Johnson muss sich aber den Vorwurf gefallen lassen, zugunsten seiner künstlerischen Intention die künstlerische Umsetzung zu sehr zu vernachlässigen. Aber am Ende steht nunmal auch ein eigenständiges Kunstwerk. Es wird nur wie jedes Kunstwerk nicht jeden ansprechen.Das ist einer der größten Unterschiede von Johnsons Star Wars zum bisherigen Star Wars: die durch und durch künstlerische Absicht. Dieser Film soll nicht “nur” unterhalten. Er soll zum Nachdenken anregen. The Last Jedi ist vollgestopft mit Subtext und Anspielungen, die erst sehr viel später an Bedeutung gewinnen und er spricht den Zuschauer auf andere Weise über die Metaebene an, als man es bisher getan hat. Beispielsweise ist eines der Hauptprobleme von Abrams Episode 7, dass er zu selbstreferentiell ist. Witze und Augenblicke, die nur funktionieren, weil sie schon einmal funktioniert haben und weil der Film weiß, dass der Zuschauer sie kennt. Das ist zu konstruiert - nicht nur in Episode 7. Einer der berühmtesten Sätze der gesamten Filmreihe, ist zu reinem Selbstzweck verkommen. Und es zeichnet The Last Jedi aus, dass er als einziger Film des Franchises auf diesen Satz verzichtet - auch wenn ihn BB-8 piepst. Es ist für den Zuschauer nicht zu verstehen und doch da. Das ist bezeichnend für den Film. The Last Jedi ist genauso bezeichnend der einzige Film der Saga, der sich direkt auf seinen Filmtitel bezieht und sich nicht hinter einer austauschbaren Phrase versteckt. FANS UND FANSEpisode 8 verkennt seine eigenen Wurzeln und findet gleichzeitig zu ihnen zurück. Wie zu erwarten zitiert Johnson immer wieder seine Vorbilder, kommt im Endeffekt aber immer wieder zu einem anderen Schluss. Er erzählt eben nicht wieder das Gleiche, auch wenn er sich beim Gleichen bedient. Er verneigt sich sich sogar vor einem seiner größten Vorbilder: George Lucas. Das ist der chronologisch erste Film seit den Prequels, der den Imperator bei seinem gewählten Namen nennt: Darth Sidious - ausgerechnet durch Luke Skywalker, der ihn so nicht kennengelernt hat, sondern das erst später aufgearbeitet haben muss. Rian Johnson bringt zwar mit diesem Film viele Fans gegen sich auf, aber damit ausgerechnet gegen einen der größten Star Wars-Fans überhaupt. Er lernte noch auf der USC School of Cinematic Arts, einzig und alleine deswegen, weil George Lucas auch dahinging.  Lucas rekrutierte danach seinen eigenen Lehrer als Regisseur: Irvin Kershner drehte für ihn Das Imperium schlägt zurück. Einen größeren Star-Wars-Fan als Johnson gibt es wahrscheinlich nicht unter dieser Sonne. Johnson ist aber eben auch ein Autorenfilmer durch und durch. Er schreibt komplett alleine was er dreht - außer seine Breaking Bad-Folgen natürlich. Die verantwortet ja ein Autorenteam. Jetzt verantwortet Johnson eine komplett neue Trilogie - losgelöst von den Fesseln, die ihm ein Vorgängerfilm vielleicht noch auferlegt hat, auch wenn die Absprachen zwischen ihm und Abrams offensichtlich sind - zu sehr haben beide ihre Drehbücher aufeinander abgestimmt. Abrams änderte das Ende seines Filmes. Johnson baute nach Absprache andere Figuren in seinem weiter aus. Dabei sprach er sich auch mit den berühmt-berüchtigten Kanonwächtern bei Lucasfilm ab: der Story Group. Das schlägt sich nieder im Background seiner Nebenfiguren Vice Admiral Holdo und Captain Phasma. Beide folgen bereits der alten Star Wars-Tradition und haben ihre Auftritte im neuen Expanded Universe und wie gehabt, kommen potentiell faszinierende Nebenfiguren im eigentlichen Film zu kurz. Figurenausbau wird in Star Wars genauso traditionell ausgelagert und bleibt weiterhin optional. Rian Johnson sprach sich auch offensichtlich mit seinem Kollegen Gareth Edwards ab: Dessen Rogue One gibt sich ergänzend zur 8. Episode. VORBILDERIn einer Paradedisziplin von George Lucas ahmt ihn Rian Johnson auf seine Weise sogar nach: Im Zitieren größerer Werke, um in der Kombination ein eigenes zu erschaffen. Lucas bediente sich ausgiebig bei anderen. Er nahm die 2.-Weltkriegsästhetik und kombinierte das mit der Dramaturgie von Akira Kurosawas Die verborgene Festung. Johnson zitiert im Umkehrschluss andere Filme zum zweiten Weltkrieg, um eigene Bilder zu erschaffen, anstatt wieder nur zu kopieren. Und er verwendet einen der revolutionärsten dramaturgischen Kniffe der Filmgeschichte aus einem anderen Meisterwerk von Kurosawa: die Schilderung ein und desselben Vorfalls aus mehreren Perspektiven in Rashomon. Er konterkariert sogar eines der Symbole des Franchises: Hände und Körperteile und wer sie wann und wo verliert. Das gehört nicht nur seit je her dazu, es bezeichnet die Macht- und Verwandtschaftsverhältnisse. Man achte nur einmal ganz, GANZ genau darauf, an welcher Stelle Johnson mit diesem Motiv spielt und wieso. Überhaupt ist die Art wie er die Mysterien der neuen Trilogie auflöst oder nicht auflöst, sinnbildlich für seine Aussage. Johnson hält uns wieder den Spiegel vor und hinterfragt unsere Erwartungshaltung an Star Wars. Denn worum geht es wirklich? Was macht den Sternenkrieg wirklich aus? Sind es seine Geheimnisse oder sind es doch seine Figuren? Man kann behaupten, dass Johnson hier so einiges mit Füßen tritt, gerade weil seine Überzeugung nicht mit der eigenen übereinstimmen muss. Man kann aber auch behaupten, dass er eine gesamte Saga auf das Wesentliche reduziert - dass er die ureigene Magie von Star Wars einfängt. Eine Magie, die alle neueren Filme nicht immer erreichen, weil sie zu sehr in ihrem Korsett gefangen bleiben. Die Magie, die ausgerechnet die Werbeindustrie immer wieder anzuzapfen vermag, weil sie kreativ sein muss. EINE FRAGE DES HUMORSWas Johnson streitbar zu viel anzapft ist der Humor - genauer seine Art von Comic Relief und vor allem wann er den Bogen überspannt. Immer dann, wenn der Witz auf Kosten der First Order geht, entmystifiziert er gleichzeitig die Bedrohung. Das ist durchaus zu viel, wurde aber auch schon schlechter gemacht. Immerhin offenbart Johnson ein gewisses Gefühl für das optimale Timing, damit der Spaß als Spaß zündet. Nur das Wann und Wie oft ist diskutabel. Faktisch falsch dagegen ist der Vorwurf, es sei typischer “Disney-Humor” - vergleichbar mit Marvel. Alleine schon die Marvel-Filme an sich haben ein völlig unterschiedliches Gespür dafür, je nachdem wer welchen Film gedreht hat. Der wieder sehr selbstreferentielle Popkultur-Humor von James Gunn ist mit seinen sexuellen Anspielungen ganz und gar untypisch für den Mäusekonzern. Joss Whedons Dialogwitz ist ein gänzlich anderer als der von Edgar Wright und was in einst seinem Ant-Man davon übrig geblieben ist oder was Buddy-Movie-Ikone Shane Black in Iron Man 3 treibt. Was Star Wars immer ausgezeichnet hat, war der seinerzeit längst überholte, Beziehungs-getriebene Screwball-Komödien-Charme der 60er-Jahre - eingeführt  von Lawrence Kasdan, weitergeführt in seinem Indiana Jones und wieder aufgewärmt in seinem Episode 7. Episode 8 dagegen bedient sich ebenfalls bei den 60er-Jahren, aber bei deren Slapstick. Das ist eigentlich ein gänzlich anderer und sehr schwer zu meisternder Humor, weil eine vom Timing bestimmte Kunst. Eine Kunst, die Johnson schon in seinem Brothers Bloom geübt hat. Eine Kunst, die ihm persönlich liegt, weil er sie liebt. Aber sie liegt verständlicherweise eben nicht jedem und sie ist garantiert keine Vorgabe von einem Konzern an seinen Schreiberling. Will man eine bestimmte Art von Humor platzieren, holt man in Hollywood einen dedizierten Gagschreiber dazu und packt ihn als weiteren Drehbuchautor drauf. Außerdem hätte man eigentlich das komplett misslungene Gespür für Slapstick noch in derselben Filmreihe fürchten müssen, anstatt es zu forcieren. Stattdessen lies man Johnson machen. Man hat es gewagt und der gegenwärtige Backlash ist hoch. DIE NEUE HOFFNUNGLetztlich ist The Last Jedi das, was ein Autorenfilmer daraus machen wollte. Das und nur das. Das ist zugleich die größte Stärke, als auch die größte Schwäche eines Kunstwerks, das maßgeblich von einer einzigen Person abhängig ist. Und damit fällt das Urteil über den Film bei einer so festgefahrenen, weil vertrauten Zuschauerschaft, eben genauso ambivalent aus. Es ist das Tarantino-Phänomen: Ein Autorenfilmer prägt einen Film so sehr nach seiner Vorstellung, dass er unmöglich jeden erreichen kann, aber eben auch nicht jeden erreichen will. Er will es nur sich selbst recht machen. Das übergroße Vorbild von Tarantino, Lucas und Johnson - Akira Kurosawa - fasste dieses Grundproblem treffend zusammen: Ein Regisseur drehe einen Film für niemand anderen, als für sich selbst - und eben nicht für das Publikum. Wenn die Zuschauer den Film lieben, liege es daran, dass sie dieselben Überzeugungen haben wie der Regisseur - und nicht umgekehrt. Das ist es, was auch Mark Hamill am Ende erkannte. Sein Spiel und Johnsons eigene Art das einzufangen, verleihen einer Schlüsselszene der gesamten Saga eine weitere Bedeutung. Und man achte wieder darauf, wie Rian Johnson nicht nur zitiert, sondern wie er die Achse der Kamera wechselt, um seiner Interpretation eine eigene Bedeutung zu geben. Es ist wie bei dem Film selbst: Manches erschließt sich erst, wenn man nicht nach vorne schaut, sondern darauf zurückblickt und es dann mit anderen Augen sieht.

It remains the most flawed and yet also the most artfully experimental Star Wars movie ever made, filled with totally new cinematic language for the series but also cluttered with an ambitious attempt to analyze everything good and bad about the franchise in one film. It's a screenplay with the most lovingly complex metatextual grasp on the Star Wars brand ever written; many subplots embody major recurring ideas of the series in a microcosm, and the message speaks to the preconceived notions about the story that not just the characters in the world have, but also the watchers at home do too. It's a beautiful film when viewed thematically, but an often clunky one when viewed literally - a movie that sometimes works perfectly on paper but falls apart onscreen, and other times works onscreen but falls apart on paper. As such, it's a rare case where the haters and the hardcore fans are both right: it's truly the most subjective Star Wars movie ever made. There's very little here that can be objectively labeled ""good"" or ""bad"" - all that matters is whether it works for you.",2,278,50,96,"5,483",3-Jun-19,rated-8

THE LAST JEDI is astounding. A plethora to process... but a powerfully human, romantic adventure epic about the toils of war and failures of the past. If THE FORCE AWAKENS is a movie about being unable to build a future (it is), then THE LAST JEDI is about finding your place in it. The previous generation confronts their failures. It's not ""their"" fight, anymore but they still have a part to play. A guiding hand, if you will, to help the next generation. Not that the new generation is always entirely correct either. After all, Kylo Ren killed his fucking father. Not exactly a good egg. And even on the side of the Resistance, there's a story about even in the utmost dire of times, people shouldn't lose themselves along the way. The ""ends justify the means"" is bullshit and it's nice to have that idea continue in a series called STAR WARS. But it's ultimately focused on the battle between light and darkness. Rey and Kylo. Effectively our two leads for this new trilogy, perfectly balancing one another on opposite ends of the force. Manipulated by a previous generation's false promises and broken dreams, to the point where they might be the only two who understand one another. In another universe, who knows what they might be together. All this is set against some gorgeous imagery from First Order throne rooms to a planet of salt mines. Red, black and white give the series an imposing color palette that actively feels like new territory. Marry that with the material? This movie is beyond a dream. It's a real deal. Johnson's specific dialogue flourishes during the First Order/Resistance stuff. All before reaching peak Johnson in areas like the Canto Bite Casino set pieces with characters proclaiming how they'd like to ""burn the whole town down."" Even in a galaxy far, far away, Johnson's pop noir dialogue zings like he made it from the comfort of his backyard. TLJ feels like one of the few movies that actually earns its 2.5 hour run time since not only is there a lot of ground to cover, it's constantly exploring new territory even if there are a familiar beat or two from EMPIRE. But if you think these movies are rinse-and-repeating the original trilogy by this point, that's on you, my dudes. For everything else, THE LAST JEDI is as good as I had hoped and nothing like I expected.

Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you are meant to be.” — Kylo Ren “The Last Jedi” is the best Star Wars movie since “The Empire Strikes Back,” but it’s also a lot more than that — it’s as much of a new hope for the eroding blockbuster culture of 2017 as “A New Hope” was for the emerging blockbuster culture of 1977. Needless to say, this is something of a huge surprise. At a time when mainstream cinema is typified by the coddling safety of episodic superhero movies, makeshift “Jumanji” sequels, and whatever the hell you call “The Emoji Movie,” Star Wars is pretty much the the last place you’d expect to find someone try to shoot the moon. And yet, that’s exactly what Rian Johnson did with his first foray into a galaxy far, far away. An immensely satisfying experience that doubles as an urgent call to action for mega-franchise filmmaking, “The Last Jedi” snuck up on us like an Imperial Destroyer hiding in the shadow of a Death Star, shirking expectations at every turn and somehow resolving as both the most ubiquitous movie of the year and the most unexpected. Taking the reins of the most obsessive fandom in the entertainment universe (a responsibility that would scare most directors into deference), Johnson mounted a bonafide insurrection against an industry that’s fueled by nostalgia, grounding his story in a simple idea that was bound to ruffle some feathers and piss off some fanboys: If you really love something, you have to let it go. It’s a notion that other massive franchises should take to heart if they want to survive. READ THE FULL REVIEW ON INDIEWIRE",5,1042,37,40,"76,453",19-Dec-17,rated-9

Please feel free to comment and Follower. I really don’t know where to start, so let’s begin with my biggest discrepancy. COMEDIC TONE - I understand why this was implemented, after The Force Awakens took a big hit of being repetitive in plot, it’s understandable why they’d want to distance themselves from Empire and it’s dark tone. That’s all well and good, but the direction this takes is almost verging on being an SNL skit. The first scenes of The Last Jedi uses comedy really well, it’s smart, funny and entertaining. It's working in small bites, childish yes but ultimately easing its audience in. Why it decides to just push the boundaries further and further I don’t know. It constantly wants to do something wackier, and more stupid. Especially when the film needs to focus, in-particularly the moment we’ve waited two years for between Luke and Rey. What do you think the first moment is? Luke calling her name? Refusing the saber? Nope, he chucks it over his shoulder and walks off. Two years of waiting for one of the most anticipated and ultimately anticlimactic moments in cinema. The joke and humour are tone deaf, 90% of all the jokes and physical humour miss on impact, not because it’s Star Wars, it’s because they’re not funny at all. SNOKE - The formidable villain of The Force Awakens and what was believed to be the franchise. A mysterious force wielding and powerful mastermind that terrifies is ultimately a plot device. I’m so angry at the decision to kill him off halfway through the film without giving ANY explanation to who he is! ALL of the intrigue and mystery of The Force Awakens is nullified in this outing, we find NOTHING about him, who, or what he is. That’s not clever, it’s not a twist. It’s lazy and patronising. It’s retconning decisions made by JJ with no real reasoning, just because Johnson has other ideas. Well, that’s not how it works, unfortunately, and you’ve completely disregarded your audience. REY/DAISY RIDLEY - She’s still wooden. Her delivery at times is so incredibly questionable and sub-par. She delivers dialogue as if she’s reading it straight off the page, literally. Her character arc is interesting don’t get me wrong, but it seems all she can do is cry on cue. The characters parentage is revealed to be nobody....yeah after all the speculation her parents were drunks who sold her for booze. PRINCESS LEIA/CARRIE FISHER - The tribute of sorts to Fisher are beautiful. The slightly longer edits of her giving wisdom or those little thoughtful looks are beautifully done. She’s also written quite well, and really gets stuck in, never in the background. The character takes some really strange moments. They kill her off in the opening hour. The cinema went silent. Drastic, but full of so much more power and emotion. WHY IS IT THEN SHE REVIVES HERSELF IN OUT OF SPACE AND FLYS BACK INTO THE SHIP. Seriously, at this moment I was out. Whatever this film had left I checked off. I couldn’t care. Who made that decision was out of there mind. It’s not only ridiculous but undercuts ANY emotional impact. She’s them comatose for most of the film, and this is where the film just becomes boring and stupid. It has absolutely nowhere to go. CAPTAIN PHASMA - Shes literally in the film for 75 seconds. After how badly they wrote this character in TFA, and with all the backlash they received for under-utilising Gwendoline Christie and the promise that in The Last Jedi this would be rectified annoys me so much more. We’ve been given false promises once again, and guess what? They go ahead and kill her off. This is just a joke now. They failed to actually give Christie anything to do, one of the best characters in Game of Thrones is pushed to the sideline for other actors who mean nothing. It may come to some surprise, but Captain Phasma is one of my favourite characters because Christie was in the role. The makes me annoyed all the more with the direction. MAZ KANATA - Shes in here for 40 seconds and it’s literally forced in to remind us she’s in this universe. She adds nothing only to presumably sell toys or add further depth in a comic or TV Show. It feels as if a cut scene was used as a placeholder for the scene to be shot, but never was. DJ/BENICIO DEL TORO - I’m going to have to calm down with this one because it makes my fucking blood boil with anger. When the first official images were released we were treated to the mysterious villain DJ. Speculation was rife, was he Ezra? Is he a sith? No, he’s a bumbling, stuttering idiot! Who wrote this? I mean seriously what is going on? Why did he bother to sign up with such a terrible role? His character is a plot device, yet again, he adds nothing to the film and if you cut him out he wouldn’t be missed at all. What a complete waste. PLOT - It’s basically Mad Max: Fury Road in space. Now, that not only sounds inviting and peculiar, and you wouldn’t be wrong to be interested. But the issue is that this is STAR WARS. It’s a space opera. We can go to any planet, we can see anything, but here we’re just trapped seeing a snail race of Rebels trying to escape the First Order. Even when we get to go to a new planet with supporting characters it’s just filler with no substance. LAURA DERN - Drastically underused and genuinely one of the best things in the film. Most of the supporting cast is pretty good, all add a layer or two. It’ll come as no surprise that they kill her off, it’s just getting both old and tiresome to have to explain anything good in this film dies. LUKE SKYWALKER - Hamill gets back into this role like an old slipper, fits with ease and it’s really comfortable. His character is conflicted and they explore that really well, I never had ANY issue with his reasoning for not wanting to return to civilisation or rebuild the Jedi Order. I found it truly compelling. It’s so cool to see Luke dodge and not even having to break a sweat against Ren in the fight they have.. It builds so much emotion and power with its audience knowing Luke is the most powerful Jedi. Never mind though because this wouldn’t be Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi without a massive issue and that’s with Luke NEVER actually lhaving left said island and using a projection of himself in the final act fighting Kylo. We never get to see him actually do anything. His sacrifice is hollow because he was never really there, and then he becomes one with the force and evaporates. What a patronising and condescending way to treat your audience, who’ve you’ve just cheated throughout. It is interesting to note that Luke did keep the promise to himself about never leaving the island. JOHN WILLIAMS - It’s safe to say the soundtrack of TFA wasn’t Williams at its finest. Consided by myself and many others to be drastically insufficient. It pains me to report that TLJ is no different in that respect. It has its moments but ultimately falls flat to create a world. THE END - Luke is gone. The rebels have failed to come and save Leia and the small band of our characters are in ruin. So when the small fragments of our group have come together on the millennium falcon, all should be filled with doom and uncertainty. WHY ARE THEY ALL LAUGHING AND JOKING! It’s just inconsistent throughout, and ironically it’s the first Star Wars film that hasn’t but feels like it has been directed by two people. FORCE AWAKENS PLOT LINES - We never find out who, or why Max Von Sydow plays and why he helps the resistance aside from his obvious support to Leia. We never find anything more about Finn, whose ultimately becoming a third wheel with very little substance. We never find out how the First Order came to be. We never find out who Skoke is. We never find out how Kylo gained his mask. We never find out how Ren and Snoke found each other. It’s all just really bad connective tissue.That’s it for my SPOILERS REVIEW. As you can tell I’m incredibly angry with what direction this film took. Now, I’m not being overdramatic or ridiculous, but this film has officially ended my interest in the “Blockbuster” I’m done now. I just don’t care. They treat their audiences like absolute shit and because these franchise have devout fans who flock and love it without either acepting or realising this isn’t good only condemns things to never changing.",16,157,34,226,"3,695",14-Dec-17,0

What a massive, painful, crushing disappointment. I don't want to write a review so I'm just going to keep this short. Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi is more original and daring than J.J Abrams' previous Star Wars entry, Mark Hamill is great and there are some truly solid moments I won't spoil. But that's about where the positives end for me, and the myriad of disjointed, contrived and utterly stupid plot-holes and story-developments begin. Nearly every scene has lines or visual storytelling that is supposed to make people laugh, and it just didn't for me. I think I laughed once or twice, and the rest just fell flat. But that's not all, from parts to feel straight out of a Harry Potter movie, to inexplicable constant character changes, to a mind-numbing endless stream of action sequences (this is by far the most action-heavy Star Wars film to date), punishingly protracted sub-plots, uninteresting & flat new characters, and a Domnal Gleeson, whose hammy, cartoonish portrayal of the caricature villain General Hux is also laughably awful. The film takes a lot of chances and goes into surprising territories, but nearly all the decisions made were, I felt, the wrong ones. Oh, and the over-use of the word ""hope"" here becomes as cringeworthy as the word ""family"" in Fast and the Furious movies. The Force Awakens may have been unoriginal, but there are tons of moments that have seeped into my brain and had me giddy with joy and internal rapture. Here, between the non-stop action scenes there are some moments here and there that truly stand out, but it was mostly an overlong forgettable slog that took over 150 minutes and seven endings to finally conclude. I can totally understand people loving this, as it's very action-heavy, and thus fun for many, but that is something I simply do not enjoy in the slightest. I know a rambling oration like this isn't my usual style of review, and I might attempt to write a proper one in the future, but this film had me seething with anger, and I just had to get it off my chest. There's still probably half I forgot to mention. I'm definitely on #TeamPorg though.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,152,science fiction,adventure,action, ,353711,1.6k fans,3.32,6683,12764,9057,32072,27757,71477,51173,80034,29384,33310," we mustn't destroy what we hate, we must save what we love. This is a tremendous, immensely valuable chapter of the Star Wars saga. While I may not come to love it on a personal level as much as I do some of it's predecessors, this thing is fascinating to take in. Johnson provides a cleanse of sorts of all the baggage from this saga's long, rich history; addressed literally in the film as ""letting the past die"". The divisiveness is puzzling, as I think there's hardly been a time being a fan of this franchise has been more exciting. Progression and ambition are necessary elements to any franchise, I'm all for Johnson lugging this fan-base into uncharted territory. The most important and disarming idea to understand about The Last Jedi, at least to me, is that lineage now means nothing. Anyone who has seen these movies knows everything revolves around a single bloodline, but that seems (most likely) to be no more. People (myself included) spent two years theorizing who Rey could have been birthed by, convinced it must've been someone we knew. But no, her parents were nobodies, unceremoniously selling her off to the wastelands of Jakku. While Rey may be a nobody, she still is very strong in the Force and has chosen to be a brave, selfless champion for good. Kylo (Adam Driver is MVP here) may be descended from a line of heroes but he still seems incapable of seeing beyond his hate, seemingly destined for evil. Or the little boy at the very end, gazing into the stars and believing for a second that his life could mean more, that it could mean something. Anyone can be a hero.  The movie isn't perfect, though. Without that intangible feeling of fate, destiny and cyclical storytelling (that familar ""Star Wars hue""); the familiarity of the various subplots were a little more apparent. The politicizing, the regurgitated ""underdog"" position of the rebellion; constantly running and scraping by on the predictable heroism and creativity of it's members as opposed to the rigid, exacting First Order. I'll admit I also missed the Shakespeare-lite tragedies and breathless creative discoveries Lucas would make in each moment of his time with this franchise; the downright diabolical investment he'd made into always building and expanding on the universe he so lovingly created to the point that boundaries and logic were broken simply because the stories couldn't keep up. This is a different beast, I sympathize with those who are hesitant to embrace it.  But for every tonal discrepancy or canon-shattering twist, there was a moment of greatness that captured the illusive Star Wars magic. Rey finally becoming one with the Force felt downright profound, a meaningful portrayal of the Force as something that is always with us, found in the most peaceful moments of our lives. Just breathe. Johnson's depicted it with such clarity, such majesty...I teared up. Or Luke passing away under the light of a sunset, gently recalling the young man from Tattooine just decades ago with the simple ambition of being part of something greater; effectively born under the light of the sun only to be taken decades later, a radically changed man, similarly gazing into the light of the sun, at peace in his final moments. It's an affecting use of an immortalized moment in cinema, gently engaging in the familiar cyclical storytelling we've come to expect from this franchise without compromising the idea that the life he'd lived was his, and his alone. These are the moments that remind me why I've always loved Star Wars. It's not the thrilling action, dazzling effects or boundless creativity; its the spirituality. What is Star Wars but a story about hope? Seeing light when there is darkness, hanging our heads in desperate hope of redemption, rescue or revolution; and holding to the simple belief that what is good will win out. In that belief, The Last Jedi holds out hope for a generational change; a belief in that small, nameless dreamer somewhere far away who has not yet resigned themselves to a galaxy run by the greedy, corrupt and power-hungry. This is now a universe of self-determination, with a much-needed message of peace and acceptance. Unconventional? Radical? Unfamiliar to this franchise? Perhaps. But this movie, however unsteadily, underscores precisely what this franchise has always been about. It's unmistakable.  Star Wars Marathon (ongoing)",5,156,16,145,"4,873",14-Dec-17,rated-10

And while The Force Awakens undoubtedly resuscitated the franchise, it was too formulaic and didn't drift sufficiently from its precursors to create a genuine permanent impression. Step forward writer and director Rian Johnson. Johnson had the chance to give rise to something genuinely different for Star Wars fans with this episode, and the outcome more than exceeds expectations.

One minute there’s off-balance humor, the next, there’s serious seriousness. Potential breakout characters are frantically introduced, only to see their story arc, obliterated in the mist of chaotic chaos. I’m not going to lie; the opening act is a hot mess, but thankfully, for the most part, the pace and tone improves as the film progresses. We have three stories going on at once, and they’re all competing for our full attention, which is why, there’s such a bloated runtime. Story One: The triangle between Luke, Rey and Ren. Kylo Ren is one of the most improved characters from the previous film. He’s less emo and Adam Driver brings his A game to the acting table. Rey is left in limbo for most of the movie, only to finally see the light towards the end. I can’t say any more about Daisy Ridley, because I feel like it would spoil the movie for those who haven’t seen it. Luke’s journey and destiny are probably the factors most viewers are conflicted with. I can see both sides, and I’m leaning towards disappointment in the way Luke’s story takes its course. Also, it can be debated that we have Mark Hamill playing Mark Hamill and not Mark Hamill acting as Luke Skywalker. Luke’s character at times is a parody of what he once was. But, we must remember, it has been over 40 years since Luke first found the force.  Story Two: The Rebel Resistance with Leia and Poe. It’s bittersweet watching Ms Fisher. We can debate she’s the glue that holds this film and franchise together. If Leia’s story isn’t finished, there will be problems with the advancement of the overall story. Carrie Fisher was a very strong woman, and Leia Organa is an impossible character to replace. Poe, once again is a hothead. But, I’m not ready to crown him the next Han, like I thought I was after The Force Awakens. He’s a character whom would benefit from a side project Solo movie. What we can conclude about Poe after TLJ is he’s really close to BB-8. The rest of his mindset is still a mystery.  Story Three: Finn once again going on some wild adventure, but this time, it is with TLJ’s breakout star, Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico. Rose is a breath of fresh light in the Star Wars Cinematic Universe. She steals every scene she’s in, has a relatable backstory, and if she survives this episode, might be the HOPE we all need in times of great distress. Her positive attitude, and her outlook on life, are examples we should all follow and admire. I do believe John Boyega is continuing to grow into Finn’s shoes, and he’s improving enough, that I believe we have yet to see the best of Finn. Another aspect that helps the story of Rose and Finn is the introduction of a certain DJ played by another scene stealer, Benicio Del Toro. DJ might be my favorite character from the film.  TLJ does bring to the table a lot of action scenes. With some more organized than others. I do believe the die hard fans will be excited about some of the Sci-fi excitement, only to be majorly disappointed in a couple of critical action events. Fans should enjoy seeing new planets, worlds, creatures we haven’t seen before, and maybe just maybe, a surprise or two for the lifelong Jedi at heart. Rian Johnson gives a valiant effort, but I do prefer Gareth Edwards’ tone of Episode 3.5, Rogue One over TLJ. However, I do believe Rian will learn from his errors, and when he directs the new Star Wars Trilogy, can perhaps, direct something truly special.  Full review on YouTube at:Todd Gaines Talks Film",7,152,23,577,"10,953",20-Dec-17,rated-7

Man weiß gar nicht so richtig, wie man diesen Film bewerten soll. In seinen stärksten Momenten ist er so, wie man sich heute einen Star Wars-Film wünscht. In seinen schwächsten Momenten verkörpert er alles was falsch ist an heutigen Blockbustern und der damit verbundenen Ver-Disney-sierung. Ich habe Episode 7 vorgeworfen, dass er sich zu wenig getraut hat. Das er ein guter Fanservice ist, aber praktisch keine eigene Identität hat. Ich habe JJ Abrams vorgeworfen, dass er sich nichts getraut hat, dass er ""auf Nummer sicher geht"" und wie in vielen seiner Projekte zuvor, ein Meister im Fragen aufwerfen ist, aber wenig davon versteht diese Fragen zufriedenstellend zu beantworten.  Das alles kann man nun nicht unbedingt Rian Johnson (""Brick"") vorwerfen. Insofern bekommt er von mir auch Respekt für eine wesentlich mutigere Herangehensweise und eine eigene klare Vision.Allerdings ist das gleichzeitig auch (s)ein Problem. Denn so sehr man auch Episode 7 nun mal kritisieren mag, er ist nun mal da. Er ist Kanon und Rian Johnson hatte hier kein Spin Off zu drehen, sondern ein weiteres Kapitel von etwas Größerem. Am Ende des Tages hat Rian Johnson nur eins von neun Kapiteln geschrieben und sich dabei das Recht rausgenommen, ein stückweit auf alle anderen Kapitel zu scheissen. Du kannst nicht einfach reinkommen und sagen ""Ey ihr Fucker, Harry Potter trägt jetzt Kontaktlinsen und hat sich die Narbe weglasern lassen!"" Das ist es, was ich Episode 8 am meisten vorwerfe. Er bricht mit einem Stil, mit Plotlines, Charakteren und einem Kanon, der über Dekaden gewachsen ist und mit dem Millionen Menschen weltweit sich wie mit einer Religion identifizieren. Das ist eine große Verantwortung und ich behaupte, dass Johnson dieser nicht gerecht wurde.  Slapstick-Elemente, die aus einem ZAZ oder Mel Brooks Film stammen könnten, machen aus Figuren wie Hux oder Luke Skywalker Karikaturen. Das ist durchaus unterhaltsam, keine Frage. Aber genauso wie ich mich bei einem Jumpscare erschrecke, ist mein Lachen, wenn eine Szene mit enormer Spannung aufgebaut  und dann Sekunden später durch einen albernen ""Punch"" gebrochen wird, nur ein Reflex und keine echte Emotion. Es ist ein 'Cheap Trick', den die Marvel-Filme seit jeher bis zum erbrechen zelebrieren. Etwa wenn der Held seinen Hammer, Schild, Umhang, die Rüstung oder sonstigen Device lapidar  und nicht mit dem zu erwartenden Respekt behandelt.  Das passt aber nicht wirklich zu Star Wars, sofern man nicht vorhat, die DNA einer 40 Jahre alten Erzählung zu ändern. Generell ist der Humor der ""alten Trilogie"" eher in kleinen Dosen ( Perrier?) vorhanden. Natürlich hatte man mit Han-Solo einen Sprücheklopfer oder mit Ewoks und C3PO auch Comic Reliefs. Ich habe auch nichts gegen lustige Szenen oder One-Liner bei Star Wars. Der große Unterschied zu Episode 8 jedoch ist, dass der Humor niemals die Ernsthaftigkeit der Charaktere untergraben hat. Es gibt keine Szene, die Vader zu einem Lappen werden lässt, oder einen lapidaren Spruch, der aus Tarkin ein Comic Relief macht. Es gibt keine einzige Szene, bei der man daran zweifelt, dass Luke Skywalker es ernst meint mit seiner Mission. Und in dem Moment wo Luke Skywalker, oder Tarkin, oder Vader, oder der Imperator ihre Sache ernst nehmen, nehmen auch wir als Zuschauer sie ernst. Wir tauchen ab in eine mystische Welt, eine Space-Oper von epischen Ausmaßen. DAS ist Star Wars. Eher sich ein bisschen zu ernstnehmend, als sich mit der so unglaublich angesagten Meta-Ebene selber die Butter vom Brot zu nehmen. Wir sezieren jeden Happen, den man uns vor die Füße wirft. Entwickeln Theorien, analysieren Frames und zerlegen Trailer. Warum? Weil wir uns fucking noch mal mit der Welt identifizieren. Weil es eben nicht einfach nur ein Weltraumabenteuer ist. Das sind Charaktere die uns seit Kindheitstagen begleiten, deren Geschichten wir besser kennen, als die unserer eigenen Vorfahren. Das kann man albern finden, aber man sollte es respektieren. Und es ist diese Generation an Star Wars Fans, die am meisten unter Episode 8 leiden. Nicht der 10-Jährige, der Yoda von seinen Corn Flakes kennt und Spider-Man sowieso geiler findet.  Und es ist genau das, was ich persönlich an Star Wars  liebe. Ein Universum das sich ernst nimmt. Rian Johnson nimmt fast nichts an Star Wars ernst. Er nimmt nicht mal Episode 7 ernst. Er vernichtet fast alles, was ihm nicht zusagt. Er hat auch gar kein Interesse an Erklärungen und Antworten auf Fragen, die er nicht selber gestellt hat.  Episode 8 fängt grandios an. Mit der besten Weltraumschlacht seit Rogue One (...). Wenn plötzlich ein Dreadnought aus dem Hyperantrieb in unseren Fressen landet, dann ist das einfach geil. Natürlich kann ich mich fragen, wo eigentlich dieser Dreadnought herkommt. Warum die First Order eigentlich solche Schiffe hat und warum das Kräfteverhältnis von Rebellen und First Order überhaupt so ist, wie es sich jetzt nun mal darstellt, aber wenn juckt's wenn es so geil aussieht?Man merkt recht schnell an welchen Charakteren Rian Johnson gefallen gefunden hat und hier hat der Film auch seine Stärken. Denn wenn JJ Abrams etwas kann, dann ist es ""casten"". Die Besetzung war schon in Episode 7 top und ich komme nicht umher um festzustellen, dass Finn, Rey, Poe und Kylo Ren durchaus das Zeug haben eine neue Generation an Star Wars Filmen zu tragen. ""The Last Jedi"" (TLJ) ist dann am stärksten, wenn es um Kylo und Rey geht. Die Grundidee die der Film verfolgt ist nämlich pur Star Wars: Gut gegen böse, hell gegen dunkel, Jedi gegen Sith. Und irgendwie gehört es halt auch dazu, dass man sich fragt, wer den Verführungen der mächtigen dunklen Seite erliegt und wer nicht. Es ist nicht neu, aber es funktioniert und ist eben das Leitmotiv im Krieg der Sterne.  Der unsägliche Mittelteil mit dem generischen Kasino-Abenteuer von Finn und Rose, muss ich natürlich erwähnen. Er fällt so stark aus dem Rahmen, dass man sich wirklich fragt, warum er überhaupt im Film gelandet ist. Diese Zeit hätte man so unglaublich Sinnvoll in andere Story-Stränge stecken können. Stattdessen muss ich mir die beschissenste Star Wars halbe Stunde seit der Lovestory von Anakin und Padme in Episode 2 über mich ergehen lassen. Momente, in denen man bei einem Star Wars Film tatsächlich auf die Uhr schaut (wtf?) und auf Blu-ray vermutlich vorspult. Was hätte man alles machen können. Erklärungen für Snoke und sein Verhältnis zu Kylo Ren. Ein Reminiscence an Han-Solo (der quasi nicht erwähnt wird). Mehr Infos zu den Geschehnissen im Jedi Tempel und der Ausbildung von Ben Solo unter Luke Skywalker. Ein tödlicher Virus, der alle Gungans vernichtet... Nach Finns Arbeitsbeschaffungsmaßnahme ""Canto Bight"", geht es wieder aufwärts und der Film fängt sich wieder. Grandiose Szenen im Thronsaal von Snoke, eine geschichtsträchtige Weltraumexplosion und der, zumindest optisch ansprechende, wenngleich ultra-dumme, Kampf auf dem Salzplaneten Crait lassen das Herz wieder etwas höher schlagen. Am Ende gibt uns Rian Johnson dann doch für ein paar Minuten einen Luke Skywalker, wie man ihn kennt und lässt ihn zumindest nicht als Volllappen in die Jedi-Geschichtsbücher eingehen.  ""The Last Jedi"" ist keine Katastrophe, aber auch kein Meisterstück geworden. Er wirft mehr Fragen auf, als er beantwortet. Zum Beispiel was JJ Abrams jetzt aus Episode 9 machen wird. Snoke war eine Force Projection? Einen neuen Helm für Kylo Ren? Hux ist wieder ernst zu nehmen? Wir werden es sehen. Es ist alles ein bisschen weird unter Imperator Kennedy geworden. Ein schönes Zitat liefert TLJ aber und ich finde es beschreibt perfekt, wie man mit dem Film umzugehen hat.In diesem Sinne: ""Don't fight what you hate.

Either you have the same directors/screenwriters all the way through, in which case they can sort of make it up as they go along, or you can have different directors/screenwriters for each movie, but the basic storyline is outlined ahead of time. Maybe there's a reasonable explanation for the exquisite corpse approach they took, in which not only did they have different creative teams without even a sketch of the trilogy's storyline, but there was apparently minimal communication between the two teams. But I find it mystifying on both artistic and economic grounds. I think either a Rian Johnson trilogy or a JJ Abrams trilogy would have been better than the trilogy we're actually getting.  All that said, and without relitigating the monster that is the TLJ discourse: TLJ is my second favorite Star Wars movie, and the first one since ROTJ in which characters make decisions that feel like they aren't predetermined, and bear real moral stakes. The Rey/Luke/Kylo stuff is as good as anything that Star Wars has ever done. I think there are valid reasons that TLJ might not be to everyone's taste, but making a Star Wars movie, under these circumstances, that tastes like anything at all is an accomplishment.

Johnson deploys a few basic narrative and visual tricks that haven't really popped up in a STAR WARS film before, along with his usual precise frames and tight technical craft, and a particular attention to emotional continuity. There's also a welcome preoccupation with collateral damage, both physical and psychic. One thing Johnson's films have never really been, though, is elegant. As in his previous stuff, certain beats here are sometimes actively clumsy, there's some serious tonal whiplash, and pacing stutters. But all of this, positive and negative, adds up to a genuinely idiosyncratic, maybe even auteurist work. Johnson may be the first guy since 1977 to make a STAR WARS movie feel like a personal one. At its very frequent best, it seems downright off-brand.",1,1967,25,265,"25,337",11-Dec-17,rated-8

I honestly feel like every scene makes me go ""oh shit! I forgot all about how great this was."" • Paige Tico's heroic moment in the opening scene absolutely works on me, and it's wild how such a minor character sticks with me every time I watch this movie. • I love the porgs. I love them. • Wise old hermit legend Luke on his mountain is fantastic. The scene where he vaults over the canyon pass, the shot where he's carrying the giant fish up the mountain– it's all outstanding. This is how Johnson hammers home that Luke has become the incredible, mythical figure people wanted him to be– he's fucking Paul Bunyan. He even drinks milk straight from the cow. He's every god-awful early 2000s Chuck Norris joke come to life. • Say what you will about the scene of Leia in space (actually, don't) but the music that plays as she flies back? One of the most beautiful songs in the entire film. That's what really makes the moment for me. • The way they play with nostalgia in this movie is leaps and bounds better and lighter than in The Force Awakens. The moment of R2 playing the Leia hologram for Luke is such a delight. • Look, I'm not trying to objectify Laura Dern as Holdo, because Laura Dern as Holdo is a terrific character and Laura Dern as Holdo deserves to be recognized for how well she plays this unknown character that we are meant to distrust as Laura Dern as Holdo comes out of nowhere to lead the entire Resistance. That said– Laura Dern as Holdo, please step on me. • Kelly Marie Tran is GREAT? She owns absolutely every scene she's in. • The way the Force telepathy scenes are shot so that we just see them looking of screen is some goddamn magic. This feels like the first Star Wars film where shots are framed and set up in a particular way for the story, and not just pointing it straight ahead because you have to see what's happening, or because adding handheld camera shake in post makes it seem more real (it doesn't) • There isn't a single scene in the entire series like the scene where Luke guides Rey as she's feeling the Force for the first time. The way the scene is interspersed with shots of other things feels decidedly un-Star Wars, in the best way. For all the talk about how the original Star Wars is just The Hidden Fortress, this feels like the first Star Wars since that one where Kurosawa's influence can be felt so strongly. • I have mixed feelings about Canto Bight like everybody else, but I will say it plays much better in the score only version, because when you're just focusing on the music it becomes clearer that Canto Bight is this film's cantina scene. You want an even more wretched hive of scum and villainy? Well, here ya go. It's rich people, blissfully ignoring the war going on and playfully gambling on the same ground that animals are being abused for their entertainment. As far as world-building goes in this franchise, adding more aliens is cool– but putting a face to this world's analog of capitalism and wealth and greed and evil in a way that isn't the one-note evil we've seen (""I want power and that's why I'm bad"") is rad. • Luke discovering Rey & Kylo together is ALSO rad, and I love that the hut exploding was done practically because you can feel it. • Rey fighting Luke fucking rules. Every fight scene with Rey so far in these films has been fucking great. • The Luke/Kylo flashbacks are astounding, and I've written before about how well Johnson characterizes both Luke and Kylo differently in each of them, but WOW. The way Luke looks so evil with the green reflecting in his eyes in Kylo's flashback. The way Kylo looks like an innocent little boy in Luke's. They can all do so much with just lighting and looks, and it works so damn well. • Yoda showing up is a killer moment and I remember not expecting it in the theater but being so happy when it happened. • Every single second in the Red Room is absolute gold. Start to finish. If one of you nerds tries to tell me about how the fight choreography is off or whatever, I will scream. I don't care. It's perfect. • The destruction of the Resistance feels so real and painful the way it's cut with the Red Room sequence and with Finn/Rose being caught– which really hammers home just how necessary and great– • – The hyperdrive scene is! Laura Dern as Holdo strikes again. If only she were still alive to step on me. • Crystal foxes are cool as shit, and so are the crystal caves! Holy fuck! I wish I could've watched this on the big screen again. The entire sequence on Crait is outstanding. Every single shot of it. Even the way Poe slides into the trenches is outstanding. This is the most beautiful Star Wars movie, bar none. • my pal Shrill said it best, but Luke facing down the First Order is the single most badass thing a Jedi has ever done in this series. It is leaps and bounds cooler and emblematic of wisdom than any crazy, jumpy, masterful lightsaber duel people had been wishing for. • Poe meeting Rey for the first time is still a weird moment where I go ""oh right, you guys haven't... huh."" • Rey lifting the rocks is a POWERFUL image that absolutely works on me, even though the rocks themselves look bad. Still good. • This is absolutely my favorite Star Wars film and I don't think I would think anything more than ""oh yeah it's kind of fun"" about Star Wars if it weren't for this film.",23,1400,91,116,"44,961",5-Sep-19,rated-10

This film mainly works because The Force Awakens (and to a lesser and smaller degree, this film) sets up the characters and world again in a familiar and almost predictable way. Then The Last Jedi barges in like your drunk uncle at Christmas and fucks EVERYTHING up. This is the best thing about The Last Jedi, it's not your typical Star Wars. It definitely doesn't betray the mythos or iconography, but it doesn't cherish it either. Rian Johnson takes calculated risks and it pays off in dividends. The plot works quite well, the first act is mainly set up, focusing primarily on Rey trying her best to convince Luke to rejoin the Resistance; 2nd act is setup, and this drags a little bit, but the humor and action make it far more entertaining then it ought to be. I'm also not too sure if all the Canto Bight stuff fails because the Rey/Luke/Kylo Ren/Snoke stuff is so strong, that it's hard for the B-plot to keep up, or if it's just that it's bad. I dunno. The third and final act is a blitzkrieg of revelations. Which makes it even more impressive. Johnson uproots Star Wars folks, and like Empire it leaves things in a weird place that I'm still unsure of but excited fully to see. I'm sure 90% of you cringed when I referenced Empire, this isn't an Empire clone. I know that'll be a concern. It's not, it's a unique film. The most interesting (and polarizing) dynamic of this film will be that of Rey/Luke/Kylo Ren/Snoke. Parallels are drawn early and PLENTY of risks are taken with this dynamic. Again. Luke told you folks, this isn't going to go how you think. The Last Jedi is a lot of things, but I would sum it up as a 'quintessential post-modern Star Wars film'. It does interesting things while including what matters. It intelligently changes the formula in a way that will satisfy, and challenge, long time fans of the franchise.",10,113,3,21,255,12/12/17,rated-10

Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you are meant to be.” — Kylo Ren “The Last Jedi” is the best Star Wars movie since “The Empire Strikes Back,” but it’s also a lot more than that — it’s as much of a new hope for the eroding blockbuster culture of 2017 as “A New Hope” was for the emerging blockbuster culture of 1977. Needless to say, this is something of a huge surprise. At a time when mainstream cinema is typified by the coddling safety of episodic superhero movies, makeshift “Jumanji” sequels, and whatever the hell you call “The Emoji Movie,” Star Wars is pretty much the the last place you’d expect to find someone try to shoot the moon. And yet, that’s exactly what Rian Johnson did with his first foray into a galaxy far, far away. An immensely satisfying experience that doubles as an urgent call to action for mega-franchise filmmaking, “The Last Jedi” snuck up on us like an Imperial Destroyer hiding in the shadow of a Death Star, shirking expectations at every turn and somehow resolving as both the most ubiquitous movie of the year and the most unexpected. Taking the reins of the most obsessive fandom in the entertainment universe (a responsibility that would scare most directors into deference), Johnson mounted a bonafide insurrection against an industry that’s fueled by nostalgia, grounding his story in a simple idea that was bound to ruffle some feathers and piss off some fanboys: If you really love something, you have to let it go. It’s a notion that other massive franchises should take to heart if they want to survive. READ THE FULL REVIEW ON INDIEWIRE",5,1042,37,40,"76,453",19-Dec-17,rated-9
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,152,science fiction,adventure,action, ,353711,1.6k fans,3.32,6683,12764,9057,32072,27757,71477,51173,80034,29384,33310," Buckle up. This may be long-winded. As early as the very first scene, I knew something was wrong. Hell - as early as the first words in the opening title crawl. The First Order reigns. Um…since when? When the fuck did that happen? I saw The Force Awakens three times and I seem to recall the First Order getting their ass kicked super-easily at every turn. This film takes place almost immediately after the last one, so when exactly did the First Order rise to supreme dominance in the galaxy? Let’s think about this for a moment. The Galactic Empire was defeated 30 years prior. The Rebellion won. However, at some point along the line, the First Order rose from the ashes of the Empire and conquered the galaxy? Where did they get all of the funding, the resources to build massive superweapons and fleets of Star Destroyers, find and train legions of faithful followers and gather the strength to reduce the Resistance to almost nothing?  Recently I found myself wondering who was in control of the galaxy in The Force Awakens, because the movie never made it clear. Star Wars makes it clear from the opening shot - little Rebel ship running from the enormous Empire ship. Without one word, even a child knows where the pieces are on the board, but TFA never contextualizes the larger conflict, and it left me scratching my head.  At the end of The Last Jedi, the First Order is stronger than ever and the Resistance has so few members, they can’t even play a pick-up basketball game. How did they go from ruling the galaxy a short time ago to handing over seemingly all power to a ruthless upstart totalitarian dictatorship? What are they, Democrats? How do you fuck that up? What is the First Order offering that the Resistance isn’t? The larger galactic conflict makes no sense. This, of course, is a problem with the previous film, but we can pretend that events of catastrophic significance happened off-screen at some point that allowed the First Order to rise to dominance. Now, let’s dive into The Last Jedi. In the first scene, Poe is sent to distract the bad guys while the Resistance can flee from their base. Okay, I’m game. But when the base is evacuated successfully, Poe sticks around to keep shooting. Leia tells him to come back and he says something about how it’s a great opportunity to take out a huge ship (that we’ve never seen or heard of before and therefore have no idea exactly how much of a blow it would be against the First Order if he succeeds). Leia’s response is to send absolutely every bomber ship they have (nevermind the stupidity of bombers in space), which are all destroyed immediately. The attack does, however, take out the huge ship, but at such a significant cost, it hardly seemed worth the effort, and it makes Poe look like a fool for endangering so many Resistance fighters for an attack that caused exactly no setback for the First Order.   I found myself thinking, “Wow, is this really happening? Is this how this movie is written?” The answer is, unfortunately, yes. The movie then apes The Empire Strikes Back in having the Resistance flee the First Order, although glacially slow in comparison to Empire’s constant momentum from always visiting new and exciting locations. The conflict in this movie is just a little moment involving maybe 8 ships in the middle of open space, and it makes the film feel very small and almost insignificant in spite of reminding the audience that the fleet which is running from the First Order is *the entire Resistance*. And this is what it comes down to? A conflict of unimaginably infinitesimal scale? Talk about going out with a whimper. I’m okay with the flight itself, but adding the idea of this being the last of the Resistance feels like tacked-on stakes. Speaking of tacked-on, what in the mother fuck is up with the detour to the casino planet?  I have so many questions. Why are we shown what is essentially an Earth-like setting and environment with Earth-like characters and Earth-like situations occurring in a god damn galaxy-spanning epic space opera? This is not imaginative. Why do we have to be told that animals are being harmed? How does that fit in with the rest of the movie? Why are there so many codebreakers at this place? There’s one in their prison cell! Why am I watching the heroes ride around on space horses during a cataclysmic upheaval of power? I’d rather watch a fucking pod race. The biggest question of all - and the most egregious and inexcusable screenwriting fuck-up I’ve seen in a long, long time - is…why did that detour even happen? Lilac Dern had a strategy, and it was a pretty good one. She would cloak the transport ships so they could escape to the mineral planet while the First Order continues to chase the larger carrier, which would allow the Resistance to regroup at their new and fortified base. But you know what? The plan doesn’t work if you don’t fucking tell anyone! (although Del Toro knew about it somehow; figure that out) There is actually a scene where Poe storms into the control room and demands to know what the strategy is. WHY didn’t Lilac Dern just tell him? Then he wouldn’t hatch a side-quest with Finn and an unnecessary new character to find a codebreaker that they never needed.  I’d like to remind you that we’re talking about one of the most famous series of films in human history, owned by one of the largest corporations to ever exist. They have the world at their disposal, an essentially unlimited budget and every resource they could ever hope for…and they give us the Roger Ebert Idiot Plot. This is unacceptable. What was obviously set up as a way to combat ""mansplaining"" and the distrust men have toward women (particularly those in power) ends up validating the man's criticisms. He agreed with the plan when made ultimately aware of it by Leia. There was no transparency under Lilac Dern's command, and it was her stubborn and idiotic refusal to answer a very valid question about the fate of everyone on the ship that depleted morale to the point where Poe deemed it necessary to find a way to save everyone. The whole point of the scene is undermined by the scene itself. Great writing, guys. A better movie would have Lilac Dern's plan be made known to Poe, who disagrees with it and then hatches his own. Then the conflict becomes who has the better idea (and therefore, who is more fit to lead), which could teach Poe a valuable lesson when he learns that pursuing his idea is exactly what leads to the failure of Holdo’s. But he never learns that lesson, nor does he learn from his mistake with the Dreadnought that caused the death of literally half of the Resistance.  And an even better movie would get rid of pointless Holdo altogether and simply keep Leia in command instead of benching her in favor of an extra from The Hunger Games. Give the light-speed collision scene to Admiral Ackbar instead of throwing him out like yesterday's trash off-screen. He deserves a heroic sendoff, not this random person we just met. How did she earn that moment? All she did was stand around for 40 minutes while the fleet got destroyed.  Going back to Poe, the movie desperately needed a scene where Poe understands exactly how badly he fucked up (twice!), but no such scene exists. He’s the cocksure leader from opening crawl to opening credits, and that is extremely disappointing for a movie that wants to be all about the failure of heroes. You actually have to show the characters understanding the consequences of their actions, not present the guy at the end the same way you do at the beginning of the previous movie. How does that scene not exist in this movie? I'll tell you why - it's because Disney doesn't want children thinking about real loss and real emotion when buying action figures at the toy store. And because of it, Poe looks like he either doesn't understand, or he doesn't give a shit.  Anyway, if this is the entire Resistance running from the First Order, where is the rest of the First Order? We still have absolutely no measuring stick of their reach. They have the entire Resistance stranded, running low on fuel, and unable to jump to light speed. Why didn’t they call up a few more ships to wipe out the Resistance for good? Do they have no more ships? Surely they do, and we know they are not in use, considering this is, as we’re told, the ENTIRE Resistance. Bring in another one of those Dreadnoughts, you dumbasses. This movie would be over in 6 minutes. While on the First Order ship, Finn tangles with Captain Phasma, who has less screen time than the opening title crawl, does nothing, then dies. Rian Johnson couldn’t have disrespected her character more if he wrote a scene where Finn squirts a runny shit into her helmet. If that’s all you’re going to do with her, why even bring her back into the story? She exists only to sell toys. This disrespect is a running theme with The Last Jedi in that it seems to disregard what happened in the previous film(s). So much of what transpired and what was presented in The Force Awakens is now inconsequential. The best sequels - like The Empire Strikes Back - take what was presented before and expand on it and go deeper. This movie throws it all away.  Captain Phasma? Punk bitch. Dead. Supreme Leader Stroke, the main villainous threat in the First Order? Who the fuck knows. Also dead. Finn’s injury? Totally healed right away and he’s as good as new. Destruction of Starkiller Base? Who cares. The First Order is stronger than ever. Kylo Ren's cool mask? That's gone forever. Knights of Ren? Forgot they were even a thing. The big mystery surrounding Rey’s parents? Turns out, they’re a bunch of drunk nobodies.  I actually appreciated that Rey turns out to be just a random person, like Luke in the first film. Seeing ordinary people succeed in the midst of great conflict and struggle gives the viewer the sense that they, too, can do great things, that their life has meaning and they shouldn’t give up on their goals no matter what obstacles stand in the way. The story takes on a much different, much more cynical and depressing meaning when everyone important turns out to be from the same interplanetary royal wizard bloodline, and ordinary people play no role of significance in the grand scheme. Thank god that bullshit is done with.  There isn't a problem with Rey's parents being nobodies, but there is, however, a problem with building up the mystery surrounding her parentage and not paying it off in a dramatically satisfactory way. As this film ignores much of what Abrams established in the previous entry, we have no assurance that what we experienced in this movie will maintain relevance in the next. Abrams can undo Johnson's work just as easily as Johnson has undone Abrams's. So why should I, as a viewer, worry about anything that happened in this movie?  And it's not like the movie left us with anything to worry about or anticipate. It ends on a blank slate. There's no wondering how Luke will respond to Rey holding the light saber, no wondering how the Rebels will save Han, nothing of the sort. It's a tabula rasa, because the people making these films are not working together on the larger story.  The biggest problem with Rey in TFA was that she's too perfect. She was such a Mary Sue, she exceeded the definition. She was the best at everything and had no flaws. Her abilities transcend those of stronger foes who had to work hard and train to develop their skills, and she bests them right away with no training and no explanation. Here, she experiences moments of vulnerability that allowed her to develop more as a character, yet those moments were not manifest in the conflict with the First Order. It was mostly when she was training with Luke that she struggled internally. She didn’t doubt that she could turn Kylo Ren, she didn’t fear going to Snoke, she didn’t get beaten in any physical way, or even demoralized. She’s still too perfect - especially for a nobody. A character who has everything handed to her is difficult to identify with. At this point in the original trilogy, Luke attempted suicide after suffering an amputation and having his life turned upside-down with the revelation that his father is responsible for extreme evil throughout the galaxy. Rey did not suffer anything remotely in the vicinity of what Luke had to deal with. I’d hardly say she suffered very much of anything. The revelation about her parents was revealed as “something she already knew” but wouldn’t admit to herself, so that is not a new conflict. She had barely any moments of physical combat, and preformed exceedingly well when the need to fight did appear. She got a scratch on her arm. That’s about all she suffered in this movie.   In fact, most characters end the movie the same way they began. What kind of change did Poe go through? As stated earlier, he's the cocksure lead pilot from beginning to end. Showed no signs that critical lives and ships were lost because of his mistakes. What was Finn's change? Finn actually had a change, but it occurred in his sleep. He was KO'ed by Kylo in the last movie and went down fighting as a hero, but he wakes up a coward who wants to run away. At the end, he's the hero again, as if the events of the movie never happened. Leia has no arc, either. What was the point of all this stuff happening if it's not going to affect a majority of the characters? Returning to this film’s disregard for what was previously set up, Luke was introduced in TFA as the grand savior of the Resistance and the key to defeating the First Order. In TLJ, he essentially did nothing. Why was he even in the movie? He kinda helped Rey focus her powers a little, I suppose. Her character arc is that she can lift rocks now. In the end, he astral-projects himself into the battle as a distraction, and the effort from doing so kills him. So the grand savior that was so instrumental in TFA is now gone after accomplishing nothing, leaving the Resistance at their weakest. And speaking of the astral projection stuff, the Resistance thinks Luke must have come through a secret passage because the only way in or out of the cave was the shield door. They don’t know he was a mirage, so they go looking for an escape and find one twenty fucking feet away even though Luke was never actually in the cave. What the hell kind of shitty writing is this? Rey goes from fighting Kylo Ren in one scene to piloting the Millennium Falcon on the mineral planet in the next with no explanation. If this kind of thing was happening in Transformers, people would be dumping all over it, but ya’ll can’t think of enough excuses here. 5 stars, my taint. The siege on the shield door was a promising opportunity that was sadly missed. It felt 4 minutes long. The climaxes of the better Star Wars movies are all nearly an hour in length. Johnson could have ditched the casino shit and used that time to develop a proper conflict with the battering ram cannon. The door is punctured on the first hit, which makes the Resistance's ""well fortified"" defenses look puny and ridiculous. How were these people *ever* in control?  Very little about this whole sequence makes sense. Poe should have been the one to make a suicide run into the cannon, not Finn. It makes no sense for Finn to do it, but it makes sense for Poe, who already cost the lives of so much of the Resistance. He would be willing to give his own life to atone for his past mistakes, and the action of Rose saving him after he caused her sister's death would pack so much more of a punch. An alternative idea would be a successful kamikaze run. Remove Rose from the story because she's totally unnecessary, so she's not around to save Poe. Poe would sacrifice himself, destroy the cannon, and then, in a fit of rage, Kylo approaches the monstrous gate and tears it down using the force. Imagine how incredibly powerful he would look after that feat. Instead, he looks like a chump who got bested by a hologram.  Rose crashing her ship, blabbering on about how they should love each other instead of fighting the bad guys (as there's a giant death ray seconds from incinerating all their friends), and then kissing Finn is so outrageous and misplaced, it only makes sense if you assume Rose is hammered drunk. There is no context for the line, the ""relationship"" wasn't established at all, and why even bring it up with Finn when we know he already has feelings for Rey? This might be the most ridiculous part of the entire movie. They're within spitting distance from the First Order's front line of assault, but are somehow able to run a few miles back to the base without anyone firing on them, because this is the same studio that makes Marvel movies and nobody is allowed to be in real danger (yet they are all self-aware quip machines, because why shouldn't literally every character be comic relief).  On the topic of Rose, she should not exist in this story. What does she do in this movie that is so important and that could not be handled by an already-established character in desperate need of something to do? She and Holdo only exist so female characters could have moments of heroism, because making a point was more important to Disney than making a movie. I'm completely on board with female characters having heroic moments, but not at the expense of more dramatically relevant and emotionally resonant ideas.  There are so many better decisions that could have been made, organic decisions built from what was already established, but this movie totally fucks it all up. Why wasn't Finn the codebreaker, for example? He had nothing better to do, he is familiar with First Order systems and tech, and he should grow as a character to become more of an instrumental leader and hero, not pointlessly regress into a coward. Or one of the droids? That's what they're in the story for - to tap into computers and shit, to do what the human characters cannot. The chess pieces were already lined up on the board, but Johnson and Disney insisted on playing checkers.  Star Wars was always appealing to a younger demographic, but make no mistake - this movie is actually FOR children. Every character is comic relief and nobody ever faces real danger. And if you don't think this is essentially a glorified toy commercial, consider this: Star Wars toys have made twice as much money as Star Wars films. One of my biggest problems with TFA is that it doesn’t function very well as an action movie, because the action is tame, derivative, boring, and it’s all over too quickly. This same issue persists in TLJ. As an action movie, I do not want to see it again. The biggest strength of the new trilogy thus far is the character drama. In that sense, it works (most of the time). Otherwise, it’s just another big-budget money-making exercise. This movie has no proper space battle, no proper light saber duel, and no proper ground assault. What the fuck does it have on the action front? Hardly anything. This is a terrible action and adventure movie. The prequel trilogy gets a lot of flack - and all of it is justified. But what those movies did positively was expand the Star Wars universe and introduce new elements that, to this day, feel every bit a part of the series as space gangsters and carbonite freezing. We don’t get anything new here. If anything, the galaxy feels smaller, more contained. I feel like there’s only 30 people involved in this fight.  If the Resistance can’t mount any kind of offensive whatsoever, and allows the First Order to rise to conquer the entire galaxy - as they essentially have done, maybe the Resistance deserves to fucking die. What worth do they have? What evil are they preventing? It seemed like things were always terrible in the galaxy. Slave kids and animal abuse on the casino planet, unfair wages on Jakku. Was this caused by the First Order? I doubt it because Rey was scavenging for a long fucking time. How would it change under the Resistance? Would they institute animal rights? How the hell are we supposed to know what to hope for, or fear happening, if we're never told what each side represents? ""Good"" and ""bad"" is not enough.  There’s so much material to mine from this universe, but instead we get Chewbacca barbecuing a Porg (a creature that does not affect the story in any way and exists exclusively to sell toys) and Luke drinking green tit pus from a cliffside space giraffe, because if that doesn’t make you want to break out your action figures to go on an imaginary heroic adventure, then I don’t know what. And god dammit, I didn't even touch on Leia dying in space, resurrecting herself, flying back into the ship, and nobody saying a single word about it or showing any sort of astonishment to the fact that she just exhibited previously unmentioned godlike capabilities. That was never set up and it never paid off later. That was the most egregious fan service moment I've ever seen in a movie, stuck in needlessly to satiate the fanboys who wanted to see Leia use the force for no good reason. Is this movie shitting me? What an absolute disappointment. I hope someone is working on Rogue Two, because I have next to no enthusiasm or trust in Episode 9.",44,220,65,"4,490","3,513",14-Dec-17,rated-2

I must say, I couldn’t disagree more. Rose and Finn’s subplot has become one of my favorite aspects of the film. Leia’s melancholic and weighty sequences beautifully illustrate the dire straits of the Resistance. And for me, the space battles in this movie are among the best Star Wars has ever seen. Not only does Rian Johnson shoot this stuff far more creatively than any other director (observing cockpits from outside the ship, emphasizing extreme closeups and inserts) but the actual geography and stakes are always easy to follow. The logistics around the warfare might be more “technical” than any other Star Wars installment, but they also feel the most well-thought out. Of course smaller crafts would be faster and lighter! Of course TIE fighters would have close range! Of course larger ships would be harder to maneuver and easier to target, and of course everything runs on limited fuel! While many of these idiosyncrasies have been called “too real-world” compared to the relatively simple “just jump in an X-Wing and blow it up” mechanics of previous movies, they beautifully cement the reality of this universe and the underdog limitations of the Resistance.  It’s always been ironic to me that the most immediate complaint around Admiral Holdo is that “she’s an SJW” because the people who perpetuate this idea never seem to contemplate that it was Rian’s intention from the start. With her pink hair and purple gown, her dismissal of Poe and emotion-centric speech, it’s pretty obvious from the start that Holdo is supposed to fall right into all the “SJW feminist” stereotypes the dudebros despise. Including the ultimate dudebro, Poe Dameron! Holdo is a character who targets every prejudiced sensitivity within the audience, and leads them (and Poe) to assume she is exactly what she appears to be. Of course, characters revealing themselves to be more than they appear at face value has been a major theme of Star Wars from the start; Poe’s hasty judgement of Holdo calls back to Han’s hasty judgement of Leia, and Luke’s hasty judgement of Yoda. The characters (and the audience) all assumed Leia was a helpless princess, and that Yoda was a silly muppet. How wrong we all were.",2,222,13,96,"5,483",1-Feb-20,rated-9
Star Wars: The Last Jedi,2017,152,science fiction,adventure,action, ,353711,1.6k fans,3.32,6683,12764,9057,32072,27757,71477,51173,80034,29384,33310," It's still hard to know how exactly to parse this one - which I think is far stronger than it had any business being: for a while I had trouble making notes on the film in any cohesive manner outside of the films structural mechanics through editing.  However, learning that many of Lucas's unused ideas for Episode 7 were incorporated here provided a sort of gateway - it's something probably much closer to what he expected when he decided to give the series to new blood.  Even so - most of these ideas seem to be incorporated into Luke's story if any, while the rest of the film simply works around it.  Little of what Kylo or Rey say to each other during the inspired cutting together of their 'force' communication really holds any meaning - yet the formal construct: eyeline matches between totally different spaces, and because of narrative information, between potentially different planets and galaxies, remains totally brilliant.  It's odd then: what's strongest about this surprisingly solid film rests primarily upon what lies on the peripheral, or via the concepts that Lucas has already established - Johnson here is really a very talented workman given creative freedom with very rich material.  And if Last Jedi continues to hold up, its in part because of the sophistication of its editing, but also because of how well it lets itself be contextualized by the rest of the saga.  But back to the peripheral: I may very well like this film for reasons that may have not even been intentional! In his Twin Peaks review, Nick Pinkerton notes that The Last Jedi is, "" lugubrious offal almost entirely lacking in merit as art or entertainment.""  He's very likely about the former, but the latter gets tricky: The Last Jedi, until its final thirty minutes, seems to me masterfully constructed classical Hollywood storytelling.  But at the end of day, I wonder if this is less film and more industrial behemoth: what I find entertaining personally may very well not even be the film, but searching around it, navigating its rhythms: the ""force communication"" scenes are again, inspired, achieving a kind of spacial communication I haven't really seen in movies before - eyeline matches across whole worlds.  As though an (unintentional?) odd experiment in filmic metaphysics, what this could lead too is how one reconstitutes time within a film.  Now before I go on, I'm well aware that what is exciting me here may have absolutely nothing to do with the film, but the concepts which stem from what the film achieves structurally gives one many ideas for the future. Firstly - the spacial eye-line matches between Driver and Ridley makes one start to focus on the other crosscuts in the film: we have Leia and Poe on the ship, Rey and Luke on the island, Finn and Rose looking for the key person, and Kylo et al on the Star Destroyer.  While the characters never communicate through these cuts as Rey and Kylo do, what remains interesting is that the cuts hold a similar function - these things take place on different planets and in some cases a different galaxy - so each time we cut to a different sequence, we are seeing a cut of simultaneous action which nevertheless goes across time and space.  And what of the constant jumps to light speed?  There is always a striking juxtaposition whenever we cut from Leia/Poe/Holdo on the main ship back to the island - light speed contrasted with absolute stillness.  What has this to do with the movie, ultimately I don't know - but I find it interesting: how long is Rey actually being trained for? Note the difference between wipes and cuts as well: Johnson made note that the film uses the least wipes in the entire series history: only 12 (as opposed to Phantom Menace's 55).  This makes another difference in how we experience this film in comparison to the prior entries in the series: Lucas's wipes often work as a kind of 'soft' cut, propelling the story forward but also encouraging the viewer to view the progression from shot to shot (as sequences change) as development rather than comparison (this is particularly evident in Revenge of the Sith, my favorite of the Star Wars pictures).  However, by referring back to the basic 'cut', Johnson brings a hardness to each juxtaposition which in its comparision, implies a temporal shift between scene to scene because of its narrative locales.  This is interesting - because the time frame of each story trajectory is supposed to remain in simultaneity, yet we are cutting across planets and galaxies - time would be very different! BUT - if it were just for these structural constructs I'm unsure if I would like the film as much as I do: very sophisticated classical editing that calls back to Griffith rather than Eisenstein.  I also like this because it reminds me of my dorkiest attributes: it manages to play within the rules of the established material incredibly well (and moreso for me, that it relates more to the prequels rather than the original trilogy), all the while being it's own individual work.  We are often given two explanations for the occurrences of expositional events: one which works on a character-story basis, and one with works in tandem with the established mythology: Luke decides to end the Jedi because he failed teaching Kylo - but we are also told that Luke refuses to continue the Jedi Order because of internal corruption and facilitating the rise of Vader - which makes more sense, as these are the events of the prequels.  Hell, Luke even seems aware of Bill Krohn's assessment of the series: the continual reversal of sides.  Later on when we see Yoda, this introduction easily covers both fan service and also continuing these ideas: he destroys the Jedi tree himself (this is upended in the films final half-hour, but for the most part this makes sense).  There are other nice touches: the match cuts between Leia and Kylo as he decides whether to shoot or not parallels the match cuts between Luke and Anakin as the Millenium Falcon approaches the Death Star in Return of the Jedi.  And there's lots to like just on the peripheral as well  - this is Anakin's lightsaber everyone is fighting for (and is split in two by the films end), linking it even moreso with the grander aspects of the saga.  And again implications: back to the classic reversal of signs: Kylo and Rey see each others future - Rey says he will turn, and Kylo says she will turn.  It's almost a cop-out that we see Rey use Kylo's lightsaber before losing it seconds later - if anything I would have liked to see this developed further, as it would have brought the entire saga full circle! (but perhaps that's best kept for Episode 9).  There's already the thrilling implication very early on: the first time Rey and Kylo link minds, they breathe deeply for a short time before speaking - like Anakin/Vader. Unfortunately, the last thirty minutes don't really continue the ideas of the film as much as they amount to very impressive window dressing.  The film rather effectively ends when Laura Dern uses lightspeed to crash through the Star Destroyer: the films crosscutting reaches its logical end point - a set of diagonal lines collide, in fact all the films characters are now in the same radius!  But logically, after diagonal lines collide, they would begin to diverge again - instead we end up in a straight line - ending with a large-scale battle sequence on Crait with all of the films surviving principle characters.  It's in part because of this that upon revisiting, this sequence lacks any sense of dramatic impact (up to which point it has performed exceptionally well in my opinion) and exists wholly as big spectacle - the cloak is gone and the Disney machine is in motion.  But I'm not so ready to reject the film (or this sequence) on that basis - once an emotional centre returns to the film, it is working solely on the basis of nostalgia: the reunion of Luke and Leia, and his fight with Kylo.   Yet, this still doesn't quite work - Luke resolves to continue the Jedi Order through Rey - even though the film has told us that the opposite should happen!  Luke himself has pointed out to Rey, ""To think that if the Jedi die that the light dies is vanity,"" - a point which balances well off the previous entries.  Furthermore, Luke's resolve to end the Jedi and Kylo's resolve to ""forget the past,"" once more plays into the reversal of sides dynamic that this series functions on.  There is no logical reason for the Jedi to actually continue.  So why don't I mind that much? The movies final sequence is brief, yet strangely contextualizes this as a film on its own terms: the slave children we saw earlier in the picture play with handmade figurines - meant to be Luke Skywalker and AT-AT's. And the films final image is of one of these children holding up a broom to the stars as though a sword.  There's not a lot of doubt in my mind that, for many who enjoyed this film, this is also something they have done.  Toys and merchandise have been a part of Star Wars since it's very beginning - we can't pin this on Disney, Lucas has been doing this since the franchise's very inception.  But - almost touchingly, this is likely the way many of us were first introduced to Star Wars, then and now.  And there is nothing wrong with toys - if one has a problem with toys, surely they have a problem with children.  If I didn't mind the last 30 minutes (even though it makes no sense whatsoever) it's because that sequence made me feel like a ten year old again, watching the Millennium Falcon fly around into mysterious red crevasses, while speeders race to a giant cannon - it's a big toy set.   So this weirdly worked for me - I'm so often deeply suspicious of nostalgia, but surely these are the same reason I'm so touched when Luke vanishes into air: we see Luke stare into the two suns three times throughout the series - episodes 3, 4 and 8.  Each of these are a keystone of his life - birth, the decisive moment, and death.  This is completely meaningless, yet without it I never would have realized how invested I had become in these characters - so I'm moved as hell when I see Luke at the end of Episode 8, staring one last time at the two suns, but from the opposite direction he had stared in as a youth - he's crossed the galaxy, internally and externally.",9,96,2,350,"6,651",19-Feb-18,rated-7

Everyone in The Last Jedi is faced with defeat, and Rian Johnson's greatest achievement is by focusing more on paying off these character arcs rather than delivering all-out spectacle (which he still manages to accomplish with the smoothest, momentum-driven editing and detail this franchise has seen). Poe wants to destroy everything, then learns to retreat; Finn wants to abandon the mission, then is willing to sacrifice his life; Luke wants the Jedis to be done with, then accepts Rey will carry on their legacy; Kylo is skeptical about the morality of his path, then wipes everything clean and becomes the new leader; and Rey is searching for answers about her past, and after learning her parents are nobodies and her idol thinks he’s a failure, is still is able to harness the force and save the day. Everything we thought we knew is wrong and only by having the courage to not let an emotional connection with the past consume us will we move forward. Also, I loved how Johnson retconned the worst parts of The Force Awakens: straight-up murdering Snoke and making a total joke out of Domhnall Gleeson’s character. My hope for Episode 9 is they jump 10-15 years later or beyond. The young kids sharing stories about the resistance across the galaxy are older and ready to fight, Leia dies, Kylo and Rey are respectively more powerful and a massive battle across the galaxy takes place, which is what Abrams is better at anyway.",3,99,3,335,"3,742",17-Dec-17,rated-8

I don't care about the plot holes or ""Star Wars rule breaking"" that people seem to be upset about. I'm saying from a technical objective standpoint The Last Jedi is absolutely terrible. I was just gonna say that this movie is bad and not put any effort into this review like the script of this movie, but I thought I would at least defend my claims so in 5 years when everyone realizes this movie sucks they can come back to this review and view my insightful words. Yes, the script is bad. Rian Johnson the director of Brick most definitely did not write this. Brick has some great dialogue, but in this movie? Badbadbabdbadbabd!! The dialogue has so much exposition that I laughed because of it. The movie is filled with so many really dumb lines as well. There is no deeper meaning to anything and no themes to be found anywhere. The story is so uninteresting. So much stuff happens that does nothing for the plot. There is no rewatch value. ""But Caleb"" I hear you saying ""I want to see that awesome part where the main characters ride on CGI creatures through a planet we've never seeeeen in a Star Wars movie! I looooved that part! I'm getting the Blu-ray to watch it again and again!!!"" The space battles are lame and the lightsaber fights are too short to get invested in. Between the fights there are long boring parts where characters just look at each other and nothing happens. Or maybe too much stuff happens? Either way, it's real bad. The CGI is great at times but terrible in others. The overabundance of CGI will not age well, just like the prequels.Also CGI **** before he abruptly turns into a puppet looked really fake. Why wasn't he just a puppet the whole time?!?!?!? I almost forgot to mention the paper thin characters. Fin was surprisingly terrible. Luke didn't give a crap at all and you can tell. Ray just Ray's about.  Snoke doesn't do a single thing. Poe is lame. Adam Driver is good I guess, but would I say that if I hadn't seen Frances Ha? Everyone else is mediocre to bad. The Last Jedi doesn't build on anything setup the previous movie. For example when one character gets cut in half it's shocking, but then you think about it. Why? Was the whole point of the character just to die? For a crowd pleasing audience shocker? It  felt so cheap. Questions that were asked in Force Awakens are answered but it stupid ways. But hey at least Phasma had a lot to do in this movie!! Everything is made to sell toys and stuffed porgs. Even if you disagree with everything else I say in this review, you can't deny this.  And finally my biggest complaint with The Last Jedi is Rose. I've thought about it long and hard and Rose is officially my least favorite Star Wars character. Jar Jar Binks has moved up! Congratulations! All that being said, I actually really loved CGI superman Leia!!! That part was so good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",11,349,116,43,472,14-Dec-17,rated-3

I honestly feel like every scene makes me go ""oh shit! I forgot all about how great this was."" • Paige Tico's heroic moment in the opening scene absolutely works on me, and it's wild how such a minor character sticks with me every time I watch this movie. • I love the porgs. I love them. • Wise old hermit legend Luke on his mountain is fantastic. The scene where he vaults over the canyon pass, the shot where he's carrying the giant fish up the mountain– it's all outstanding. This is how Johnson hammers home that Luke has become the incredible, mythical figure people wanted him to be– he's fucking Paul Bunyan. He even drinks milk straight from the cow. He's every god-awful early 2000s Chuck Norris joke come to life. • Say what you will about the scene of Leia in space (actually, don't) but the music that plays as she flies back? One of the most beautiful songs in the entire film. That's what really makes the moment for me. • The way they play with nostalgia in this movie is leaps and bounds better and lighter than in The Force Awakens. The moment of R2 playing the Leia hologram for Luke is such a delight. • Look, I'm not trying to objectify Laura Dern as Holdo, because Laura Dern as Holdo is a terrific character and Laura Dern as Holdo deserves to be recognized for how well she plays this unknown character that we are meant to distrust as Laura Dern as Holdo comes out of nowhere to lead the entire Resistance. That said– Laura Dern as Holdo, please step on me. • Kelly Marie Tran is GREAT? She owns absolutely every scene she's in. • The way the Force telepathy scenes are shot so that we just see them looking of screen is some goddamn magic. This feels like the first Star Wars film where shots are framed and set up in a particular way for the story, and not just pointing it straight ahead because you have to see what's happening, or because adding handheld camera shake in post makes it seem more real (it doesn't) • There isn't a single scene in the entire series like the scene where Luke guides Rey as she's feeling the Force for the first time. The way the scene is interspersed with shots of other things feels decidedly un-Star Wars, in the best way. For all the talk about how the original Star Wars is just The Hidden Fortress, this feels like the first Star Wars since that one where Kurosawa's influence can be felt so strongly. • I have mixed feelings about Canto Bight like everybody else, but I will say it plays much better in the score only version, because when you're just focusing on the music it becomes clearer that Canto Bight is this film's cantina scene. You want an even more wretched hive of scum and villainy? Well, here ya go. It's rich people, blissfully ignoring the war going on and playfully gambling on the same ground that animals are being abused for their entertainment. As far as world-building goes in this franchise, adding more aliens is cool– but putting a face to this world's analog of capitalism and wealth and greed and evil in a way that isn't the one-note evil we've seen (""I want power and that's why I'm bad"") is rad. • Luke discovering Rey & Kylo together is ALSO rad, and I love that the hut exploding was done practically because you can feel it. • Rey fighting Luke fucking rules. Every fight scene with Rey so far in these films has been fucking great. • The Luke/Kylo flashbacks are astounding, and I've written before about how well Johnson characterizes both Luke and Kylo differently in each of them, but WOW. The way Luke looks so evil with the green reflecting in his eyes in Kylo's flashback. The way Kylo looks like an innocent little boy in Luke's. They can all do so much with just lighting and looks, and it works so damn well. • Yoda showing up is a killer moment and I remember not expecting it in the theater but being so happy when it happened. • Every single second in the Red Room is absolute gold. Start to finish. If one of you nerds tries to tell me about how the fight choreography is off or whatever, I will scream. I don't care. It's perfect. • The destruction of the Resistance feels so real and painful the way it's cut with the Red Room sequence and with Finn/Rose being caught– which really hammers home just how necessary and great– • – The hyperdrive scene is! Laura Dern as Holdo strikes again. If only she were still alive to step on me. • Crystal foxes are cool as shit, and so are the crystal caves! Holy fuck! I wish I could've watched this on the big screen again. The entire sequence on Crait is outstanding. Every single shot of it. Even the way Poe slides into the trenches is outstanding. This is the most beautiful Star Wars movie, bar none. • my pal Shrill said it best, but Luke facing down the First Order is the single most badass thing a Jedi has ever done in this series. It is leaps and bounds cooler and emblematic of wisdom than any crazy, jumpy, masterful lightsaber duel people had been wishing for. • Poe meeting Rey for the first time is still a weird moment where I go ""oh right, you guys haven't... huh."" • Rey lifting the rocks is a POWERFUL image that absolutely works on me, even though the rocks themselves look bad. Still good. • This is absolutely my favorite Star Wars film and I don't think I would think anything more than ""oh yeah it's kind of fun"" about Star Wars if it weren't for this film.",23,1400,91,116,"44,961",5-Sep-19,rated-10

I’d never seen this movie till now and I knew somewhat of what to expect.  This is a gimmick horror movie. Not to say gimmick horror movies can’t be good. But in this case I feel it’s gimmick is the only thing that makes this stand out. The movie is pretending it’s smarter than it actually is a lot of the time which hurts it’s enjoyment for me. There’s several “twists” that you can somewhat see coming even if you’re barely paying attention. There’s constant flashbacks to remind you of things you saw earlier that happen a lot throughout the movie. It’s like it doesn’t know if it wants to spell things out or let the viewer think of themselves, so it does both. A lot of this movie relies on loud noises and jump scares to scare the audience and that’s not really my kind of horror. I either like weird and abstract or cheesy horror. This lies somewhere in the middle and it doesn’t work for me.  The acting and dialogue in this is noticeably bad. The lead actor is alright and kind of one note, but besides that the rest of the cast doesn’t do a very good job. None of the main characters are really fleshed out so when things happen I really didn’t care for their well being. There’s a few scenes I laughed at. It was mostly in the execution and absurdity of the scene and how seriously the movie was taking itself. There’s a particular scene on a boat with a horse that I laughed out loud at. It felt completely out of place.  For some reason every scene is really underexposed and the saturation is bumped really low so everything just looks like diarrhea. Visually this movie is awful to look at. There’s a lot of out of reused footage throughout the movie. The editing is all over the place. It’s really flashy with lots of quick cuts but it’s really inconsistent in quality. Sometimes it’ll let the scene go on and other times it’ll just cut to white noise.  It probably sounds like I hate this movie but there are some things I liked. There is some unique horror in this movie. I liked the scene towards the end with the TV. I found the way they pulled off that effect to be really interesting and cool. There’s deaths in this movie that I found to be interestingly done. I really liked the music of this movie. Out of everything else I found the music to stand out, it went really well and amplified a good amount of the scenes in the movie. A VHS tape that’ll kill you actually sounds kind of stupid now that I’m thinking of it. I think it was going for an anti piracy message?  That’s about all I have to say for this movie. The more I talk about it the more I never want to watch it again. There was only one part that was scary and during that scene I was too focused on how neat the effect was. I can’t say I was bored while watching it but I can’t say I was enjoying it. Eh. I could have just said “eh” and left it at that cause that’s how I’m feeling about it.",7,40,0,"11,581","6,370",5-Oct-20,rated-4

That, in my opinion, is the message being communicated in The Ring and boy did it resonate with me. I remember having watched this when I was younger and not having thought much of it: A run of the mill horror movie that seemed to be getting a lot of attention thanks to the novelty and subsequent notoriety of ""the tape"". The obsession with the creepy girl with long wet hair character and her featuring very prominently in pop culture* being further indication to me of the mediocrity of the work presented. Right? Next! *I should admit to being quite idealistic and quick to judgement in my younger days. Who would have thought? This rewatch on the other hand... Wow!A different experience altogether. Where to start?Right. So... that central mystery you've probably heard about a zillion times (and which I alluded to earlier) with the girl in the well and how she died tragically and all that sh*t-- forget about all that. Still trite, still decidedly pedestrian.BUT...Trust me on this: there's a little gem of a movie buried under that seemingly overdone PG-13 drivel. Two things to pay attention to: The technical merits of the film, and the terrifying metaphor presented in it. These two elements really elevated The Ring into a higher echelon of horror for me. The crowning achievement here is Bojan Bazelli's absolutely stunning cinematography. It is breathtakingly beautiful and many of the shots presented will be burned into your retina in much the same way as the hoodoo content of the VHS tape in our film is supposed to. This is followed very closely by editing that is absolutely top notch and which keeps the pacing ticking briskly in spite of the two-hour runtime. Add to this immersive sound design which complements Hans Zimmer's seamless score, and finally director Verbinski's skilled blending of these technical elements while imbuing the work with heady, clever metaphor. Which segues into the other noteworthy aspect of the film: Its brilliant metaphor. In my opinion, the central horror element in the film is media consumption and how it's slowly killing us. How could I have missed that during my original screening??Like Poltergeist and Videodrome before it, the horror presented in The Ring is in the form of commentary on media for those paying close attention. From the first scene, we're introduced to two teenage girls scrolling aimlessly through TV channels while one of them discusses how television frequencies are affecting their braincells without their realizing. She is murdered by a TV screen not long after her astute observation.  Then, and shortly after having been exposed to (or rather infected by) the contents of the tape, Naomi Watts' character steps out into her balcony and spaces out some. Her eyes scan the adjacent building and its tenants as the horror sets in-- every single household in sight seems to be huddled around a TV set. These sets seem to be roughly the same size if not identical (I might have to revisit the movie to confirm this) and are placed centrally in each of the living rooms she observes-- almost like idols on altars, or daises. Later on Brian Cox's character lashes out, following Watts' prodding, that her and her fellow media content creators (she's a journalist) ""take one person's tragedy and spread it like sickness."" Sound familiar? He later electrocutes himself in his bathtub with a TV set. We learn later on that the Morgans' parenting might have been suspect as well when we visit Samara's room, perched in the upper corner of the stable. There, among the few possessions she was allotted (bed, toys, rocking horse etc...) featured a TV set quite prominently in the middle of the tiny living space-- as if to condemn the parental practice of putting a child in front of a TV screen as distraction for the child and momentary respite for the parent. There were several other examples of this throughout the film, and they really help drive the message that our need for media consumption is a sickness and that it is slowly rotting our society from the inside.  Finally, in a bleak twist that ups the ante on the film's cynicism, it's revealed that continuing to spread media content (thereby being complicit in perpetuating the problem) is the only way to ensure that one is not consumed by it (It Follows would use a similar vehicle a decade later). While this feels somewhat rushed and more like an afterthought meant to leave the door open for sequels, how prescient and fitting a metaphor for the role social media has gone on to play in our lives! In short: It might give off the impression of a Hollywood-ized, formulaic J-Horror remake, but The Ring is technically great, presents us with a deep, challenging metaphor, and because of that is superior to the countless imitations it would spawn.

It’s still very unsettling! This film is exactly that, unsettling. It’s also more creepy and sad rather than scary in my opinion. This is honestly quite a decent remake, which is very rare when it comes to these American remakes of asian horror movies! There were even some things that this remake did better than the original. The score by Hans Zimmer is great! Since it had a bigger budget than the original, it also looked better. The look of the film is definitely unique.

We were doing a horror marathon - this, The Fly, and Friday the 13th were all on the list - and we were terrified for this one.  In what still feels like an unbelievable lie, a few seconds after we watched the ring tape, the house phone started to ring.  She still had a phone like the kind shown in this movie so it was particularly eerie.  We had to pause for a few minutes after that to get some food. I was terrified of this movie after that.  Now, probably ten years later, I'm not sure what I was so afraid of. It's good.  Naomi Watts is great as usual and I find the entire story to be relatively well done.  I wish it had committed more to being a horror, as it often feels more like an investigative thriller than a supernatural one.  There are a lot of missed opportunities for classic scares.  I also think Samara's makeup and costuming tried to make her more demonic than she should have been, considering the story.  And, if I'm honest, it's a bit boring?  I can see why I liked it so much on the first watch, but knowing everything that happens made the entire journey dull.   I still like it for what it is and I will always recommend it, especially if you haven't seen it before.  It's a classic for a reason and I love how much it has been parodied in pop culture.

It's always an interesting experience to revisit it with a more trained mind in film. The Ring holds up because it's not horror for the sake of horror. It's a mystery and a puzzle. Add to that a supernatural consequence to an unfortunate family tragedy and you get a gem of early 2000s horror. It's well shot, with a Seattle bluish-greenish-grayish filter that perfectly fits the overall somber tone of the film.

Not wholly effective as a horror film, in that there’s rarely a moment of palpable suspense for either protagonist (I used to think the final “crawling out of the television” sequence was frightening but now it just seems kind of silly, frankly), and only partially effective as a statement of derelict, just “wanting to be heard.” Thought for sure this time I’d noticed the clever parallel between Samara and Aidan—both children of neglect in slightly different ways—but the ending does little to close the thematic loop, given the superficial copying of the VHS tape has no significance (that I can think of) between Rachel and Aidan’s relationship, or lack thereof. So on those accounts: Meh. What THE RING does boast, however, is a ton of legitimately creepy imagery, a compliment that’s contingent upon what one finds creepy or not. I happen to find a lot of what’s here super eerie for reasons I’m not sure I fully understand. The scene where Rachel and Noah find Samara’s old “bedroom” atop the barn and slowly begin peeling back old paint to reveal children-themed wallpaper e.g. gives me full-body goose pimples, and there’s something about old, rundown wells that make me go ”nope, nope, nope!” The coup de grâce, of course, is the videotape footage itself, which, in the hands of someone like, say, Peter Tscherkassky, would have the potential to be one of the most bone-chilling short films ever created. If the dramatic elements meshed better with the surface-level terror, I’d probably love this film. If its dramatic elements were removed entirely—and, in this hypothetical example, it were amassed as a much more abstract, directionless descent into madness with no “justification”—it might be one of my favorite horror films of all time.",2,17,4,92,"2,227",25-Aug-19,rated-6

Whilst it doesn’t have the subtlety or the eerie quality of Ringu, it’s a tightly-plotted ghost story which in a few places tops the Japanese film in delivering scares. The story is mostly the same as the original, with Rachael, a journalist played by Naomi Watts, hot on the trail of a cursed VHS tape which causes anyone who watches it to die after seven days. She foolishly ends up allowing not just herself but her estranged ex-boyfriend and young son to see the footage, and things go downhill quickly as the spirit of a murdered girl begins to pursue the family. The movie makes the interesting choice to delve further into the characterisation of pre-ghost Samara, in the process making her an almost sympathetic figure, at least initially. Unfortunately, the film misses the opportunity to develop the human characters quite as strongly. Watts and Martin Henderson are fine as the two leads but neither has a well developed personality and they aren’t terribly interesting to watch for two hours. Their son Aidan is effectively creepy but his Omen-esque performance is a little cliched.       CGI is used more extensively than in the Japanese version, which is a mixed blessing-the climax of the film loses some power because of the distracting 2002-era special effects, whilst the performance-driven Ringu has held up better over time.  Gore Verbinski toned down his normally bombastic style for this but it still isn’t the most subtle of films, and it is missing some of the more intricate foreshadowing and background details from the original. On the positive side it has two extremely terrifying moments which are arguably more disturbing than anything in the Japanese movie, mostly thanks to some very effective makeup.  One off-putting stylistic choice in the movie is the green tinge which seems to cover all of the footage, at least in the Amazon Prime version. This might be intended to show an unnatural, haunted atmosphere, but it instead just gives the impression that it was filmed under green floodlights. This effect might not appear in all cuts of the film- in some online clips the colour palette is more blue-grey. If possible try to avoid watching versions with this effect.   The Ring is an efficient horror machine which delivers its money’s worth of scares. It’s more accessible than the original, but also less likely to haunt the imagination.",7,30,0,"2,693","1,546",22-Sep-20,rated-7

A whole lot of things can change; from capturing the foreign atmosphere of hills, homes and streets, right down to cultural nuances and mannerisms – the kinds of things that are not only used to alienate audiences from the norm, but to change how the entire picture is digested from start to finish. While Hideo Nakata’s Ringu (1998) was (and still is) as creepy as hell, Gore Verbinski’s remake was the westernised world’s first big introduction to the J-Horror style of cinema and it set the bar pretty damn high, taking all the technical and performative aspects from the original and enhancing them on almost every level, while never losing the sense of cold, dread-inducing atmosphere that made Ringu so effective. Refraining from the use of unnecessary jump scares or violence, instead building a sense of impending fear, Verbnski drags you into his nightmarish vision, creating an ominous mood that ever so slowly builds to an unrushed, terrifying climax that still manages to have the same spine-tingling effect almost two decades after its initial release.",3,54,4,993,"1,522",12-Dec-19,rated-9

I'm going off this text and this text alone. I'm not convinced the film does enough to connect the theme of technological reproducibility and trauma from beyond the grave. The film provides, through exposition, the possibility of passing the curse through copying the videotape, but it's never clear why this particular medium, why VHS, why videotapes? The VHS becomes a bit of an afterthought during the long unraveling of the mystery of the middle third of the film. We're treated to long, gorgeously filmed sequences of rural horror (horse breeding farms, a lighthouse, a ferry, a secluded doctor's office, a dusty library) and of some select urban horror (asylums, the omnipresent and oppressive Seattle rain, the foreboding glass giants peering down on the little people scurrying like ants), but none of these elements do any thematic heavy lifting to connect the technology to Samara's transcendent fury.  Has anybody done any critical work connecting the themes of The Ring or Sosuki's work to Benjamin's prescient and important ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" (here)? In some ways, Samara's videotape, a  parthenogenetic creation, goes against Benjamin's argument that copies exhausts the aura of the creation. Rather, it is copies of the videotape which further strengthen Samara's power: the more people who watch the tape, the more punishment she can mete out. Her aura is never exhausted, rebutting Benjamin's famous adage, ""that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art."" Again, this is why I'm troubled by the film's lack of effort in connecting the theme of technological reproducibility with the videotape itself. I'm not asking for the film to make gestures toward Marxist theory, but I am asking for the film to answer or even impute the reason for this specific technology and not phone message or faxes or what have you. (I'm gathering this criticism I have of the film doesn't apply to Kurosawa's Pulse, hence its glowing reviews and reputation, but I haven't seen it yet).  Other than this persnickety problem, I quite like this film. Verbinski has a great ability to sustain dread while simultaneously providing stunning imagery, without either aspect overshadowing the other.

Pretty much all of my criticisms of Ringu carry over to this one along with a couple new ones.  They have this blueish green hue over most of the movie that I’m really not a fan of. Aside from Naomi Watts, most of the acting felt like it was straight out of the early 2000’s leaving parts of the film feeling like a product of its time, the intro scene specifically. They added a few “eerie” thugs throughout the movie to play up the supernatural factor like drinking water and magically coughing up hair, or pulling things off the screen when the tape is playing. And the child character feels overly precocious and kind of creepy and I really didn’t see the purpose for that. Oh and the death faces in this version are way overdone and lame. One more thing, I haven’t looked it up so I can’t be sure but I think they used Goblins theme for Suspiria like once or twice throughout the film, and if it wasn’t the track then it sounded incredibly similar. If it is the song then I think it’s weird that they used a horror track from another iconic horror movie.  The major thing I think this film does better is Sadako’s backstory. They add some details that aren’t in the Japanese film that I feel really flesh her out and Watts does a pretty good job.  Despite that my negatives paragraph is much bigger than my positive, it’s a pretty decent watch that remakes the original but adds it’s own elements to it.

""The Ring"" does a pretty good job at preserving the original story and a lot of the imagery of ""Ringu"" that I enjoyed, enough that it probably would feel fresh and effective to someone who never touched the original. It is a spooky mystery that unfolds in disturbing ways with a lot of great scares. However, having seen and loved the 1998 original, ""The Ring"" is exactly the stupid American remake I expected it to be. The acting is definitely not on the same level on ""Ringu"" (although not-Brad Pitt is kind of fun), there's a lot of extra scares and unnecessary blood to please any inattentive audience members (The horse ferry scene is the absolute worst), and boy oh boy is the film GREEN. Remember other colors? Gore Verbinski and his team certainly do not. Whereas ""Ringu"" stayed within relatively realistic color palettes, nothing too special besides some fun black-and-white stuff, the green-gray palette of ""The Ring"" is unforgettable for the wrong reasons and gets annoyingly distracting before it becomes so commonplace that you barely notice it. Only a handful of shots where the green really enhanced a scene (I have the outdoors scene where Rachel talks to Dr. Grasnik in mind. Mist really helps the color green.). The lore around Samara definitely is not as engaging as it was with Sadako, and the scene where Samara finally attacks Noah is a huge letdown with terrible 2000's era effects and make-up. ""The Ring"" is a pretty good & effective horror flick that will definitely be a treat for fans of the horror-mystery-drama genre, but fans of the original will just see this as a much more annoying green little brother to the Japanese existential psychological drama. I'm assuming people who don't like ""Ringu"" either like this more for appealing to their tastes in atmosphere and/or pacing or just hate both films because they're not a fan of the concept or what it entails at all.",6,24,0,"9,849","2,990",22-Dec-19,rated-6

Blaring and bright, shifty and formless, demanding your attention and offering nothing in return. It is the absence of meaning, imagery void of psychology or intent. It's hypnotic in its abstract banality. Every frame suggests a hidden depth, a signal in the noise, a truth you'll never find. It's a bottomless pit, waiting to swallow you up. It's a deep dark well.  No movie understands this like The Ring, and no movie scares me like The Ring. Unlike the cavalcade of ""prestige"" horror we've been inundated with these past few years, this is a film that refuses to drown its images in ""meaning."" Many of the images on the tape refer to something in reality, yes, but what's still missing is significance. Free of context, the images are both mundane (if creepily uncanny) and brashly terrifying. And they're terrifying precisely because they lack any special meaning. They could be anything, any aspect of Samara's life, any free-floating memory imprinted onto tape. They don't mean anything. But still they lure you in, begging you to investigate and analyze and freeze-frame and screencap. And then the trap springs shut.  That fear of static comes from a general fear of analog devices, which this film also has a profound understanding of. Modern technology has become so microscopic that we are completely alienated from the actual physical inner workings of it. Not so with a tube tv, or VHS tapes, or disposable cameras. Their inner workings are big enough to see with the human eye, to hear with our human ears. They click and whir and buzz without our direct input, and you can't help but feel there's something strangely alive about them. Samara crawling out of the tv is so scary because something about it rings true. Doesn't it feel like something is alive in there already? Something manifested in static, incomprehensible, something that can stop your heart just to perceive it, but you need to see, you need to look. This is a film about that self-destructive urge to bear witness to something you're not supposed to see, about staring down into a bottomless pit and waiting for it to reach out and pull you under.",3,85,2,354,"4,483",7-Mar-19,0

As a child, this film horrified me. I had never watched it but I knew all about it and I once saw the ""video"" and thought I actually had 7 days to live and some girl would come out of the TV and kill me. Now, I've matured and I've finally watched this film. Sadly, it wasn't scary at all. It's saddening but there are times where I feel like I've lost all emotion with films. I don't get scared anymore, I don't get sad anymore, and I don't care anymore. It scares me to think that films don't make me feel anything anymore. Films mean so much to me and I have a deep love and appreciation for them so to think that I may not be able to feel anything at all hurts and scares me. I've lost that feeling I use to have where I would feel so much emotion from the joy which would bring a huge smile to my face all the way to the depression which would make me cry non-stop. I don't want to lose those feelings. I hope I haven't completely lost it. I hope there is a film which can truly terrify me this month. A film which will make me scared to leave my seat and unable to leave my bed in fear of being dragged by some demonic force. I want to feel something. Anything. Gore Verbinski's remake of the 1998 film Ringu is an Americanised version of the Japanese horror classic and while it's not good, it's not bad either. I had many problems with this including the kind of bad editing, the quite bad acting (especially from the kid but you can't really blame him), and the ending which felt half-baked and rushed. There are positives though such as the lovely and beautiful colour pallete and great camera-work. I would also mention the creative and interesting concept but that was taken from the original film so I can't really list that as a positive here. In this case, I would have to say Rango and his Pirates of the Carribean films are much better than this, but this isn't bad. Horrific October 2020",4,26,11,240,370,9-Oct-20,rated-6

The plot is very similar to the original and focuses on a videotape, which leads to a mysterious death for any hapless viewer seven days later. This one is more drawn out than Ringu and tries to explain more things, which really is not to its credit. The film is rather slow to get going, but the story is suitably creepy and director Gore Verbinski builds up suspense (though again I would say not as well as the original). The plot flows reasonably well - only a detour involving a horse on a boat spoils the pacing. The main antagonist is creepy as Hell, and the famous moneyshot scene is carried off particularly well. On the whole it's fine, but generally given the choice I'd rather watch Ringu.",1,36,0,585,999,14-Sep-20,rated-6

You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it... spread it like sickness.-Richard Morgan My first time watching The Ring since watching all four original Ringu films that had preceded it. It's blasphemy to say or to even suggest that an American remake of a foreign film was a good idea or even worst suggest that it's a good film, but yes... this remake isn't just one of the good ones but it's also the best Ring film since the original. It has to be said though that director Gore Verbinski and screenwriter Ehren Kruger had the advantage that they could look back on not one, but four films to see what worked and what didn't. For the most part they do recreate the original film's plot beats, but they were smart enough to know what to Americanize and what should be left alone. Completely changing Samara's origin (Sadako in the original) was probably the smartest move the entire film takes story wise. It fundamentally doesn't change how the film plays out, but it does change the mystery our characters have to solve to survive. It's not that it's better than the original in any way, but this is where they successfully Americanize the myth behind the videotape by changing it a great deal without betraying the original's theme. The cast. Naomi Watts is great in the lead and I'll dare say that David Dorfman is better casting than the original film (I'm sorry). He comes off as this old soul in the body of a small child. You also have Brian Cox in a supporting role that isn't really comparable to the original film since the character is changed so much, but damn... Brian Cox being in your movie only makes everything better. Martin Henderson is serviceable in his role, but he is a poor substitute for Hiroyuki Sanada. My one other gripe about the movie is a scene during the third act involving a well that mirrors the original except here it feels like they had to try and ""Hollywood it up"" to make it more exciting. It still works, but it shows how the original was smarter to be subtle without going over the top. Part of:Horroctober VI: DuLac of the Dead",7,35,0,442,"6,779",9-Oct-16,rated-8

I think this will be rounding out the J-Horror portion of our seasonal viewing, which has been a fun trip down memory lane.  I think The Ring is the strongest of the American adaptations that came from the boom in the subgenre's popularity.  It's very faithful to the original, but add its own flourish to scenes, instead of taking the shot for shot route.  The pretty meaty budget permitted a lot more special effects, most of which are still pretty solid, and the sickly green wash over everything makes it chilly and uneasy.  The most interesting thing to me though, in comparison to the original film, is the quality localization.  Character arcs and concepts remain in tune, but take on more appropriate cultural stylings (the stoic workaholic versus the casually immature absentee father figure, for example).  Even simple moments like the way a someone approaches their grieving sister, or how an adult appeals to teens for information, is adjusted to feel natural, without disrupting the outline.

I have seen the Japanese version several times since then. I previously thought the Japanese version was much better but I would defend the American version from those who trash it. I realize now that I thought it was better than it was and had not seen for a very long time. I did find it very entertaining but at times for the wrong reasons. The Japanese version had a style and vibe to it that I have known for along time that the American version didn’t. The major flaw in the American version is Naomi Watts acting which is laughable at times. I felt that she is a decent actress and didn’t see her poor performance coming. The little kids delivery was also laughable at times too but he is just a kid but I found his odd robotic delivery very entertaining. This movie now is so bad it is good!

Encapsulated with a sense of foreboding, making effective use of its ominous ambience, and treading its material with patience, it's a dark, surreal & visually haunting omen that thrills as well as satisfies. The story of The Ring revolves around a videotape that is fabled to bear a jinx that kills its viewers after 7 days. The plot follows a journalist who conducts her own investigation after her niece & her three other friends die under mysterious circumstances, and ultimately stumbles upon the ill-fated video herself. With limited time on her hands, she tries to find a way to lift the curse. Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring is virtually a shot-for-shot remake of the original but its visual & sound design do give its images a distinctiveness of their own. Verbinski relies on the creepiness that sets in earlier in the story to keep the viewers around instead of going for conventional tricks like jump scares or gore. Also worthy of mention is his firm control over pacing & atmosphere. The whole film has a very wet, isolated look n feel that's further enhanced by its sunless ambience & cold colour tones. Camerawork is silent yet brooding, shooting locations provide a spectral aura to the film, Editing is definitely a plus, for it allows the plot to unravel at its own pace and is able to retain its mystery till the end, while Hans Zimmer's muffled score silently amplifies the eerie mood. Coming to the performances, Naomi Watts carries the entire picture with a commendable input but she could've done better if more depth was provided to her character. Martin Henderson is almost flat in his part while the kid himself looked creepier than the antagonist. The most noteworthy of all are the contents of the cursed videotape, reeking with such surreal & disturbing images that it has a mystical power of its own. On an overall scale, The Ring is one of the rare remakes that is just as compelling as the original, if not more, and is one of the better examples of atmospheric horror done right. Enveloped with a chilling layer of dread, it is an unnerving & unsettling feature that tackles its tale with restraint and revels in the tension that originates from its sinister iconography. A welcome respite from mindless gore & cheap thrills, The Ring is definitely worth a shot.",6,50,2,662,"8,792",2-Oct-17,rated-7

The Ring is precedent in that it's essentially about individuals influenced by the images and messages they consume, thus revealing the analog stimuli they're being fed and causing a final stand against the imposing force of unadulterated free thought. That the 'cursed video' is an avant-garde film only solidifies the battle against the corporatization of media and its path of rebellion against safety over free will. Verbinski, in a key moment, allows Watts' character to peek into the doll-house dioramas of modern style apartment living, all tuned in to their television sets. They're safe and sound, but are they free? It's a question that only could be posed in the VHS era, and even here in 2002, it's too late, with cell phones and the interconnectivity of a faceless world warping the complexion of every individual into profile statistics, excel spreadsheets, and government watchlists.

Unfortunately, The Ring continues that streak. To begin, let's talk about the few positives from the film. I thought that Naomi Watts for the most part did a great job with her role and was the best thing about the entire film. There were a few moments where I thought that another take maybe could have been warranted, but for the most part I greatly enjoyed her work. While the actual ring video I think became a bit too silly and haphazardly strung together, there was a sequence with worms crawling that transitioned into an overhead shot of people swimming I believe. It absolutely made no sense for the video, but it was a neat visual that I enjoyed. And finally, while most of the film's score didn't seem to really capture me the way the originals did, Hans Zimmer still had some good tunes, and the one that begins to play as the character Noah searches through a number of files was fantastic. Those are pretty much all of the positives in my eye. The vast majority of the rest of the film is terrible. The biggest fault it has is in its changes to the main story, especially with the introductions of horses as a pretty central plot device. As I stated before, the actual haunted tape is worse, and Samara's design is terrible. A huge thing in the original 1998 version is that you never see Sadako's face, even when she was alive. You see Samara's face all the time in this version. And it looks ridiculous in the worst way possible. The same can be said about the people who die in the films. They just look cartoonish. The film tries so hard to be scarier than the Japanese counterpart, but fails miserably and doesn't really have a single scary moment in it. Another huge glaring fault lies in the color palette of the film. Everything looks so washed out and faded, and when comparing it to the bright colors and great cinematography of the Japanese version it just looks really really ugly. And they don't even stick to it either. There is a really great set of shots near the end of the film at sunset in the Cabin setting, and it just makes the surrounding film look even worse. I just really hated The Ring. I was expecting to enjoy this movie. I remember liking it. And I am completely fine with changing up things for remakes, in fact I think you should. But all of these changes were for the worse, and a lot of the fantastic themes of the Japanese version were completely lost for terrible jump scares, ridiculous sound cues, and awful acting (except Naomi Watts).",6,20,1,314,"3,613",8-Jan-20,rated-3

The first act is the most gonzo, featuring: * two surreal dream sequences* on-screen cameos by Arnold Schwarzenegger's cum, Chris Meloni with hair, and Arnold Schwarzenegger's piss* Emma Thompson, but only Emma Thompson, doing slapstick* Danny DeVito saying things to Arnold like, ""Strong swimmers. Big load. Way to go!"" and ""Time to put a bun in your oven!"" Like a lot of speculative fiction, it calms down a lot once it's done establishing its alternate universe. The steps necessary to get there, like Danny DeVito talking Arnold into getting pregnant in order to prove the efficacy of the experimental drug they developed together, are way stranger than Arnold going on to experience the predictable effects HRT and pregnancy. Yup, HRT. Trans exists in this universe, which is actually sort of an unusual feature for trans/adjacent speculative fiction. I've noticed a tendency to treat the viewpoint character as the first-ever gender nonconforming person even as the writing takes advantage of real-world trans experience. No mention of trans men getting pregnant, however. Uh, it's hard to call this progressive, exactly, but it does pass up a lot of opportunities to be cruel that many other comedies would leap on. Arnold lives at Danny's house while he brings the baby to term and they end up in a pretty domestic situation, but it's a lot less gay panicky than I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Maybe it's because the writers think that this is safely confined to the realm of fantasy, but they're a lot less anxious about changing social formations than the last movie I watched, You've Got Mail.",6,3,3,81,74,8-Mar-19,0

But with Junior, this is by far his craziest outing by a long distance, well premise-wise. Junior sees Arnold Schwarzenegger collaborate for a third time with Reitman after previous successes in Twins and Kindergarten Cop, as well as Arnie teaming up again with Danny Devito since Twins. Junior is yet another one of those movies that I didn't watch when it was initially released in cinemas, nor bought on video, based on the idea alone, which I thought was just beyond absurd. So absurd that I thought it would make for a terrible film and I avoided it as a teenager. But being older now and by suspending my disbelief, I finally caved in - and whilst as over-the-top as it is, it's not too over-the-top and silly as people have made it out to be. In fact, there is also a warmness to it that prevents it from becoming too eccentric and ridiculous, as well as a perceptiveness and somewhat compassionate quality that Junior exuberates. Scientist Alex agrees to become a human guinea pig by using his own body to test a new fertility drug. With the effects of the drug taking its toll on Alex, he later realises that being pregnant makes him see things in a different light, as well as view his relationship with Diana. This is Arnold at his most restrained, performance-wise, without all the macho action-hero antics and explosions and though a lot of people have said that he cannot act, this is the second movie where he plays against type (Twins was the first), and interestingly and surprisingly, Arnold rises to the task. Though one wouldn't normally associate him with this type of role, just by thinking he is limited in his range, - which he isn't- and being typecasted as an action movie star, never mind the role itself here. He is a very good actor, when his character is asked and expected to be more dramatic & expressive that is, and yet again his performance shows his versatility as an onscreen performer, whilst retaining his charm; that and he plays Alex just right. As I have stated before in my review of Twins, Arnold has that uncanny ability that other action movie actors and stars lack when it comes to branching out towards comedy movies that he manages to pull off, with ease. & as crazy as this ''man getting pregnant'' premise is, there were times in the film where the story did become a little mundane in places. Emma Thompson's character Diana, the scientific researcher/biologist plays a key role in Junior, as the egg that was injected into Alex's body, originally belonged to her; that and Alex later falls for her. She is a bit ditzy on occasions, yet has a good heart too. The remaining ensemble of Danny Devito, Pamela Reed, Frank Langella all provide good support to the film, as well as that each of them play off Arnie really well. One funny and freakish looking scene was a dream sequence when Alex holds the baby and when he looks at it has Arnie's/Alex's face on it! The comedic aspect here is very restrained, well, much more restrained, as well as touching and sweet in contrast to many of Ivan Reitman's comedy offerings, as for once it doesn't aim for the usual side-splitting sight gags, laughs and farcical humour; but that can be partly attributed towards the subject matter at hand. Of course, we have a plotline about a pregnant man, but as offbeat, as it is, you can only go as far and not take it too far as one can with it and with the comedy. By going way too far- and Junior might've been even more outlandish and ridiculous - it'll only make the idea or concept, even sillier and offputting. There was a comedy released one year after Junior, titled 'Nine Months' directed by Chris Columbus that had a not too dissimilar premise to this one; but that film wasn't as good for me as this one, Junior for 2 reasons: 1) Julianne Moore and Hugh Grant did not express the same chemistry on screen, nor did I feel them as a couple compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Emma Thompson here and 2) but for Robin Williams's presence, the writing in Nine Months was far more sluggish than this film, and that it didn't make me smile throughout. Likewise, out of the two I prefer Junior over Nine Months. Having said that, I felt that Junior needed to provide more of the type of humour that was from Twins (although I was a tad disappointed with that aspect in that film) and amusing moments and that it relied a tad too much on cliches and trivialising on the experiences of pregnant women. Otherwise, though the laughs are bare minimal, Junior retains a sense of humanity and is relatively heartwarming, and but for the premise, the movie was trying to point out how a man would react and feel if he was pregnant and in a good natured way. But that was also something the critics and some viewers couldn't get their head around. This could have turned out to be a complete and utterly horrible mess, but in viewing Junior, contrary to many, that was so not the case for me.  But seeing Arnie in drag, as daft as he looked, was such a hoot! Though it is not the usual laugh-riot one would expect in an Ivan Reitman comedy film, - and this coming from a viewer of his films, Junior still has plenty of heart in places too. You need to set aside all the crazy ideas and just think beyond of the idea of a man getting pregnant. Given there has been a man who has given birth to a child in real life, as a film Junior, therefore, is no more as absurd as the plot is itself, and it's not just Arnie who impresses, but the rest of the cast deliver too, along with an emotional quality that Reitman and the writers have managed to carve out. Billed as a farcical comedy and besides the absurd premise, Junior, is in fact, an enjoyable piece of fluff that is charming in places, more so than outrageous and silly through its humour and with really impressive performances. It's a film that doesn't deserve the bad rep and bashing it received - take no notice of the IMDb rating. If you go into Junior with an open frame of mind, as I've done, you will find it enjoyable and worthwhile.",12,13,0,535,702,6/2/18,rated-8

How did Arnie's career survive this? It's not unwatchable and thanks to DeVito and Thompson it has moments of humour, but I can only wonder how better this film would have been if someone who could just act could have taken the lead role. Arnie makes for a great one-note gag on the film's poster, but that's it. Stallone or Kurt Russell, hell, even Seagal (who would have worn one expression the whole film) would have been better.

It’s not exactly a comedy because it isn’t funny.  It’s not exactly a drama because it isn’t dramatic.  It brushes over explaining the science fiction element so it isn’t interesting.   I’m at a loss. This should have never left the pitch meeting.  “I have this great idea.”“I’m listening.”“It’s sort of a romcom where a man gets pregnant!”“Mmhmm, and….?”“Uh…and the man is Arnold Schwarzenegger!”“Yeah, and…..?”“Uhhhhh….Danny DeVito…….” That’s as far as it should have made it.  Shoot it down there.  It’s a one note joke, put the world’s biggest toughest action star in a feminine role.  Have him wear a dress at some point.  That is the level of humor we are dealing with and even with that most simplistic weak premise, they still fuck it up!  Arnold plays it dead serious like a comedy vacuum.  Even DeVito sucks in this.  The tone is peculiar to say the least and I still have no clue what they were going for.   This is as bad as it gets people.   The only vaguely interesting part is when Arnold is dreaming of holding a little baby with his own face superimposed on it.  That was so bizarrely out of place and trippy I enjoyed it but that is literally IT.   Why in the hell is Emma Thompson in this?   Kill your agent sister.   In fact, anyone who had anything to do with this should have had their fucking heads examined.   Reitman, you made Ghostbusters and then you sucked and Harold Ramis took over your career and made actually funny movies.  Even your son is a better director than you.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I think I even liked Howard the Duck more than this one.  At least that movie sort of knew what it was going for.

Yes, the writing is 95% of the time terrible, and it's not funny most of the time, but you somehow just have to love this ridiculous crap. I don't give a shit if film history hasn't been all written, nobody makes better faces or grunts than Arnie. He is hilarious without trying.  DeVito is great too and it's nice to see him and Arnie returning for Triplets. Oh, and Eddie Murphy. That shit is going to be fucking hilarious. And whatever happened to Pamela Reed? She was in everything in the 90's, now she's doing nothing. Fuck, she's 64! It might be nostalgia, it might be Arnie or it might be the overall idea of Arnold Schwarzenegger giving birth, but this unfunny wreck of writing actually has some bizarre entertainment value to it, with it's quotable lines such as ""I'm pregnant"" or ""my nipples are sensitive"".

What I would want to go back and see is the initial pitch meeting for Junior.... I want to see the looks on Arnold Schwarzenegger & Danny DeVito’s faces  when they realise that they have an Oscar nominated  classic on their hands... The moment when Arnold rocks up to the meeting and turns to the receptionist ""so why don't you use a regular actor like Dolph Lundgren"".  When out of the shadows you hear DeVito call out ""cause some damn fool accused you of being the best""...  Schwarzenegger slowly turns in realisation he spots Danny and yells out ""DeVito you son of a bitch"".  The two exchange not a handshake. But a MANSHAKE. In all seriousness though Junior was one of the most awkward comedy's I've seen in a long time. Mainly because none of the jokes landed and when the movie was trying to be serious that's when it was most funny.

Pierce Brosnan wearing comfy sweaters and taking off his reading glasses dramatically while saying ""Jesus Christ!"" in a strangely fake-sounding Irish accent is totes my aesthetic. He spends 90% of the movie in this state.  2. That's it. That's all the good.  Now, onto the bad: 1. What a disappointment. I expected more from the director of CASINO ROYALE and GOLDENEYE with a cast like this.  2. This can only casually be classified as an actiom film. There is very little action and it's all lack-luster. Jackie Chan tries.  3. Jackie Chan could literally be excised from the film AND NOTHING WOULD CHANGE PLOT-WISE. HE LITERALLY DOESN'T IMPACT ANY EVENTS OR ANY DECISION-MAKING DESPITE BEING THERE FOR ALL OF IT.  4. Every woman is dead or evil--or eventually evil and brutally killed.  5. There is a random unnecessary subplot of evil, manipulative aunt/poor, misguided nephew incest. It ends with him casually shooting her in the head in a quick camera cutaway.  6. Of a group of five criminals: four are men and one is a woman. The four men are shot and killed instantly. The woman is brutally tortured (including implied sexual torture) by police. This is shown as both necessary and just.  7. The man who does the sexual torture is Martin the butler from THE PARENT TRAP. This was deeply distressing.  8. Jackie's tragic, motivating backstory includes his wife and three daughters all dying. One daughter in the film-starting terrorist attack and the other two BY BEING RAPED AND KILLED BY PIRATES WHEN THEY WERE 8 AND 11.  9. Jackie is almost exclusively referred to as a ""Chinaman."" (The title of the novel this was based on is literally called The Chinaman--a fact which made both Josh and I literally gasped as we saw that credit come up on screen.) 10. The IRA are the villains in this film made in the year of our lord 2017.  11. There is no good person to root for. I think we were supposed to root for Jackie, but he was setting up bombs and mutilating people because they wouldn't give him information THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE. I was rooting for Pierce, because even though he was cheating on his wife--at least he wanted peace in Ireland and also only killed one person in the movie. He also wore cozy sweaters all day long.  12. This was (poorly) written by a man. 13. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING. Honestly, this is actually brilliant if you consider it instead as the logical conclusion of violent, toxic masculinity. Women die so men can feel rage so they can kill and destroy aimlessly in pursuit of vague concept of justice. If Jackie had just chilled and I don't know gone through grief counseling--THE TERRORISTS STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT.  Whatever. I have put too much thought into this. Long live cozy sweaters and high-hopes for women to start living through action films.",19,7,7,68,300,18-Oct-17,rated-2

A lot of people seem to be amazed that Jackie Chan can be dramatic but the reality is that Jackie Chan has made dramatic films throughout his career, they've just never been as popular as his Action/Comedy films. The movie itself is nothing special and has some plotting issues. The biggest problem with this movie is not the acting which is pretty damn great all around or even the story which is generic but not bad, the problem lies in the fact that it really seems like two films based on the same script spliced together. What I mean by this is there is one story about Quan's search for vengeance and there is another about Pierce Brosnan and the police trying to stop any further blood shed.

I didn't expect much of this movie, mostly a generic action movie, with Jackie getting up there in age, and Pierce Brosnan not always being able to convince me, especially after his Bond movies. I could not have been more wrong. Or well, it was kind of generic, but in an enjoyable way. It was fun, incredibly well-paced, and surprisingly well-acted. The hours flew by for me, where usually a movie like this could be grating to watch at times. Jackie Chan wasn't his usual cheery self in this movie, being older, and heartbroken after an event early in the movie. This could've ruined the movie for me, being a fan of his more witty work, but it didn't. Chan used to be my favorite actor when I was young. He was my hero, and I even considered taking on martial arts because of him. I later changed my mind. I found out that even though he's a very admirable actor, possibly one of the most admirable out there, some of his acts as a human were poorer.  Yet, whenever I see a Jackie Chan movie, I just know that I'm in for a good time. He makes movies fun just by being there, even when he's as stoic and broken down as he is in this movie. Maybe it's time that I separate the actor and the person so that Jackie Chan might once again become my favorite actor.

In one of his most surprisingly emotional charged performance, Jackie Chan really displays why he became such an iconic action star in the first place and completely owns the screen, really nice return to form. Pierce Brosnan also gives one of his best performances in quite a while, while the action and fight choreography are slick and handled well by Martin Campbell, one of our better action directors of today (minus the one obvious hiccup of his career). I was attached to Chan's character and wanted to see him get justice. I do wish this would've contained at least another set piece or two, and wasn't always so heavy on its political angle & double crosses, which are fascinating and suspenseful enough in its own right, but it does hurt the film's pacing. Regardless though, while it's not going to blow anyone away or offer up any real originality, this is a solid time at the movies for any Chan fans, and honestly one of my more pleasant surprises of the year.",1,16,0,115,707,13-Oct-17,rated-7

With that having been said, it's also fitting enough to say that Jackie Chan is always a delight to watch in the action genre when the film gives him enough room to work with - leaving part of me to hope that this would be a chance for the better side of Martin Campbell to show itself once again. To some extent, it was worth it for The Foreigner proved itself to be much better than it had much capacity to be - even if its more lackluster elements still are noticeable. Jackie Chan stars as Ngoc Minh Quan, a Vietnam War veteran living in London as a Chinese restaurant owner putting his past behind him up until the moment his daughter dies in a politically motivated terrorist attack. After her own death, he swears revenge on the murderers and even pursues a government official who may have connections with the bombers. Perhaps the story itself isn't the strongest suit of The Foreigner because of the rather predictable plot threads that come and go, but even the film's weaknesses seem overshadowed by moments of ingenuity that don't seem expected for the sort of film it would be. Maybe not always as suspenseful as it seems built up to be, but for what it is, entertaining enough it retains. Campbell's knack for creating an action sequence is present, but it seems as if this is where Jackie Chan's best moments on the screen come about rather than humanity behind his own tragic backstory - which we see in glimpses and only feels rushed at that. They're moments that feel like they could have created more impact had they been expanded upon, but they disappear along with Chan's presence for a good amount of the second half where he just feels relegated towards one area the whole time. Nevertheless, when he comes on the screen he does deliver a thrilling action sequence one after another: only showing that Jackie Chan hasn't lost what made him the wonderful action star he had been recognized as over the years. It's a good use of his own talent if anything else could be said, even if we know he still can manage to provide better. There's no secret present that The Foreigner is a politically motivated film, now with the government official being surrounded at his own ends with acts of terrorism ultimately becoming his own responsibility - now set to be taken down by an Asian, an older woman, and a black police officer. When the novel was written, it was a plausible enough premise because of what was going on in the United Kingdom at the time, so perhaps in response to how America is running its own government it would only make clear that The Foreigner seems angry and calls like a warning - if the development of Brosnan's character arc says enough, from his own rise and fall as his own history as a former IRA member catches up behind him. It's a tad troubling though when The Foreigner seems to have no idea about how to set the tone of its own societal commentary. For the most part it seems bent towards forming vicious action scene after another, almost in a campy nature at that - especially with where Jackie Chan's character has been reduced to in the second half of the film (Quan seems absent in the strangest sense considering he is the film's leading force). It isn't the same campiness that ultimately has rendered the commentary of a work like Starship Troopers even stronger, but one that only seems distracting in some sense just when trying to piece together what The Foreigner wishes to say. It can't establish a tone that gives itself a new identity, but the occasional bits of brilliance make it more enjoyable. Even if the tone of what I wrote prior seems rather negative, I can still say with ease that I enjoyed The Foreigner on the count that seeing Jackie Chan doing what he does best as an action star once again was truly satisfying. Martin Campbell's skills as an action director do make themselves clear again, but his own faults as a storyteller are present. Nevertheless, it's nice to see how The Foreigner manages to tie in with the current political climate especially in its anger towards government officials - maybe it isn't the most subtle but it makes for a good way to pass time.",6,18,0,"1,347","6,793",17-Oct-17,rated-6

So it's safe to say I was mostly left out on all the homages to Chan's celebrated career, and watched this movie as someone who didn't feel anything when seeing Chan again. But even beyond those contextual aspects, this is a rock-solid movie. A political thriller featuring bits of martial arts goodness; it begins with Chan's daughter being killed by a rogue IRA bomber in London. After mourning her loss and seeing no progress in the capturing of the bombers, he takes it upon himself to terrorize the bureaucratic systems into finding results and cutting through politics. In all honesty, Pierce Brosnan was the MVP for me in this. He kills it as the leader of a reformed, politically driven IRA; and as Chan's sort-of victim throughout the film. There's a surprising depth to the story here, many layers to peel back that Chan's character doesn't even factor in to. The writing is astute and well-paced, and the action never felt misplaced despite it being far from the center of the film. I really enjoyed this one. Well executed, reasonably intelligent and wholly satisfying; The Foreigner is one of the more unexpected successes of the year for me. 2017 Ranked",2,35,8,145,"4,873",14-Oct-17,rated-7

Directed by Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale, The Mask of Zorro), the film stars Jackie Chan as a grieving father who's daughter was killed by a terrorist organization. After being unsatisfied with the answers given by politician Pierce Brosnan, Chan goes rogue to figure out who's behind the bombings and what's really going on behind the scenes. The movie tackles several genres; it's part action film, part gripping drama, and part political thriller, and I'd say about 2/3s of the blends really work. The action sequences are amazing and well-choreographed, and seeing a 63 year old Jackie Chan still show his excellence in stunt choreography was such a blast. As a drama, it also works great, as we get to see a darker side of Jackie Chan that we've never seen before, with so many tragic layers unfold in a man haunted by grief and loss. Piece Brosnan is also excellent and shows a different side of his persona playing someone also trying to cover up the mistakes of his past, leading to some really gripping sequences. What does falter this movie, unfortunately is the political thriller aspect. The drama inside the politics is gripping, but I found the mystery a little too convoluted for its own good and some of the subplots and double crosses hard to get invested in these it mostly involve characters I don't give two craps about. The pacing also drags when the spotlight goes away from Chan or Brosnan, which is a shame , because the film had so much potential to be amazing. There's a lot I still really liked in it, despite being bogged down with a little too much meat for its own good. It's really great seeing both Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan playing against type and the action sequences are a blast, so in the end, I say it's worth at least a solid rental. If the pacing and structure was improved, I'd have put in one the same boat as Casino Royale, but I did enjoy this over GoldenEye at least (I still think that Bond film should have gone to Dalton instead of Brosnan).  62/100",8,11,0,268,"1,035",15-Jan-18,rated-7

Old man Jackie Chan starring along old man Pierce Brosnan and being directed by old man Martin Campbell is like the golden reunion that I never thought I would want so badly and I’m so glad that I got in such a fresh delivery that makes for the best of each of their talents. With The Foreigner easily being one those “Their best since…” kind of movie for each one of them, even if is nothing of mind-blowing hallmark of brilliance, still presents itself as a pretty decent well put together film! That even if the appearances of its revenge-type plot may suggest it and define it as a action film, Campbell goes to show yet again that, since the pretty snubbed Edge of Darkness and his glory moment in Casino Royale, that his interests as a filmmaker go beyond just the action per action sake and is quite more interested in focusing and following character beats internal dramas that builds the men that he throws into this exhilarating situations of pure sheer badassery. And for this being a Jackie Chan starred film anyone can immediately think this is ought to fell in into one of his recent Chinese films that almost all follow the same cheesy action formula effect, but no, this is straight up bittersweet drama territory for him, with few breeds of brutal hitting action, where he shines all the same. Structured around with your conventional political terrorist thriller that could’ve easily been made in the 90s and starred Harrison Ford in it, only smartly (and boldly) setted in modern age’s political tensions in the United Kingdom setting, just added with a clichéd revenge plot of “a father going after his own daughter’s killers” inside of it and you get The Foreigner. But even inside those standards, what’s so refreshing about the films is how it doesn’t play with pre-conceived ideas of plot and clichéd conventions and goes to make an interesting mix of both types of story to a full intriguing effect. It ain’t a plot of heroes vs villains as much a fight of ideals and personal goals with morally questionable actions from all sides. The entire first thirds of the film are filled with deaths happening, attacks going on and more and more characters you don't know if you can trust showing up, sometimes with unclear but mostly with clear guilty ones behind it, especially ones where we are suppose to root for. But you get caught never really knowing how to feel about it because it is in the internal nuances where the entire mystery lies and all the characters seem to be acting in their rightful ground of the actions they take. Not fully pursuing the factor of “who done it or why”, and rather being more interested in making questions like who’s the morally correct in the story, or who’s right or wrong behind it all, or who are the real evil forces at play here as the two main characters end up going against each other for their own fair beliefs and intentions, and none are wrong or bad…apparently.  All before the cutting double crossings reveals and outcomes explode on screen, that even by them it leaves you constantly guessing in suppositions and glued to the screen, eager to know what’s going to be the outcome of all the mystery behind all the deaths and attacks that are happening, that though is kind of pretty obvious from the get go who’s the main responsible for it all, even the film doesn’t hide it when the “big twist” reveal comes at play, but it doesn’t cease to add more layers into the mix of real responsible ones, questioning their decisions and motivations, as it never ceases to entertain and cause action and reaction with the audience from what’s happening on the screen, and if a thriller is doing that you know is doing something really right! I only wished David Marconi’s script were more ambitious than its standard procedural ground of suspenseful mysteries and twists and turns, and go a bit step above its structure of revenge plot mixed with a political terrorist thriller. Because frankly, it isn’t as smart or sharp to deep explore the complex themes its plot packs, or tries to, from the political repercussions of terrorism and the brutal consequences of the choices, orders and actions carried out within this universe, almost touching Bigelow’s Zero Dark Thirty terrain only mostly inside the political spectrum. All tied long with a father’s personal trauma story of going against everything and everyone that took everything of good he had on his life by unleashing his worst. The structure may be unconventional to pack all that, and intriguingly engaging as such, but the ground it covers is mostly pretty standard expected territory, and maybe there’s just too much characters to handle aside its main two protagonist that are basically perfect each in their own, though the nephew/aunt incest sub-plot is quite disposable, but even in that there's not really anything that harmful because everybody is doing the job the narrative uses them to make and they make them in all the right notes settled by Campbell’s direction, and all the cast is actually pretty solid. But the script is skillful enough to intersect both of its main character stories into one without much conventional paths and sustaining a cohesive storytelling well put together. Let me just say that grizzled Jackie Chan, even if maybe it isn’t the best Jackie Chan, is definitely one of the best Jackie Chan I’ve seen! So fine when a movie shows the real acting chops of a real living talent that manages to kick ass in both the action and drama of its story and character as he does here. We instantly feel his grief and imediately grow sympathetic towards him once tragedy falls upon him in bittersweet way,  thus making us to root every step of the way for him to get the people responsible for this and Jackie the Chan out of them. Making us feel anxious to the next scene where we are going to see him do Jackie Chan shit in full out glory! This movie just shows how he can do all of the John Wick survival acrobatics only with high energy and performance believability.  Being thrown off windows and avoiding the fall by clinging to a cable on mid air and sliding down, all in one take, instantaneous boner right there! He’s basically playing a Chinese Rambo here, even doing some Rambo shit in the woods since using booby traps with nails and darts, and non-lethal brutal blows just like in First Blood where he’s coming from a war-veteran past seeking to live a calm life and only resurrecting that past of his once he has enough of seeing another one of his loved ones being coldly taken from him. The downside is that he should’ve been so much more in the film than he really is, though again his part of the story is pretty rounded up and cohesive without taking anything away. What is interesting is that this is a star-produced film by Jackie himself, but he leaves a lot of room to Brosnan to shine chewing some real amount of scenery, and to Campbell work on his magic. Brosnan in particular is just a complete badass even without playing a hit of action here, with the exception of one really stand out torture scene where he’s just an absolute boss, but being a real badass on his really great acting, extra benefited by finally giving him a chance to pull his Irish chops out and perform on his native accent. And he really goes to steal parts of the film just for himself with his great character, where we may know he’s on the wrong side here by made with intentions he believed might be the right ones, though also corrupted, but without the intentions to harm anyone. Again, is the film smartly being able to keep us on the doubt on how to feel about the characters and their respective sides as they come from fleshed out intentions and humanized performances, specially Brosnan who’s absolutely un-hateable, even though his actions, and the even worse ones he let’s lose are caused by dangerous impregnated extremism from a past of violence not overcomed in the past IRA cultural scars, which becomes the real villain of the story and the main cause of all the victims. One of them being the character of Jackie who happens to be an old killing machine that ends up going against another war of terrorism deaths and murders occurring by corrupt leaders and selfish decisions, action metaphors are also the best metaphors! Forming this entire confrontation of motivations and ideals between both main characters pretty much sums up the entire chain of events that structure the thriller aspect of the film, that are mostly pretty story drama based, but with exhilarating breaks and hiccups to some action spectacle. And you know the action is doing a phenomenal work when every big kick or punch has a impact of excitement feeling coming from them. It always had been the area of expertise of Campbell and he shows why yet again, for how much every frame shows to be perfectly planned out, and the editing is meticulous calculated, specially on the final half real nail-biters thrilling sequences, almost David Fincher-esc level, as if his usual classicism was now getting geared modern updates. While the action portions of shoot-outs explosions and fist-fights are masterfully choreographed along with the clear calibrated framing, along with the actors doing most of their own stunts, is all just a blast. And Jackie spares compliments, he’s just old and still doing his craft like an energetic teenager punching and kicking with real brutality showcased in his performance, and seeing him on full murdering rampage near the end is just absolutely pleasurable to behold, as it this entire film as a whole! It may be nothing of new revolutionary, neither had to be, but it has enough unconventionality in the way that it constructs its basic plot to turn it into something both morally complex and thrillingly engaging.  From the potent drama to the action badassery, leaving its two main starts shining high on both areas, Campbell shows he still packs some real steam on him, as so does the often snubbed talents of Brosnan and the supreme kingdom of Jackie Chan martial arts still lives on high! So please Hollywood, give this people creative freedom and more work to do for god's sake!",14,18,2,348,937,9-Jul-20,rated-8

After a legitimately sad opening, the film slowly dissolves into socio-political action pulp with Chan posing the biggest threat the IRA have ever faced since sanctions from the UK.  This was just pure nonstop fun once the first Jackie fight scene commences. What I found highly intriguing was how long it took for Jackie Chan to begin fighting at all. You'll need to wait halfway through the second act before the actual fighting starts, which made for a much deserved payoff. His scenes are a little more brutal than normal with almost no comedy and all pain. It's literally kickass in every way. I already wanna see it again to a good extent.

An action thriller starring Jackie Chan in a surprisingly dramatic role. Chan plays a retired Navy Seal, who's now a small business owner, that goes on an obsessive revenge fueled mission after his teenage daughter is killed in a terrorist attack. The movie costars Pierce Brosnan, Michael McElhatton, Charlie Murphy and Orla Brady. It was directed by Martin Campbell, who's also helmed two James Bond movies; 'CASINO ROYALE' and 'GOLDENEYE' (also starring Brosnan). The film was scripted by David Marconi, and it's based on the 1992 novel 'The Chinaman', by Stephen Leather. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office as well. Maybe this is the resurrection of Jackie Chan or the final farewell. Either way Its pretty awesome to see him still going at it.  Ngoc Minh Quan (Chan) is a retired British Chinese Navy Seal (in his 60s), who now owns a small business. Having already lost family to tragedy, Quan is completely heartbroken when his remaining teenage daughter (Katie Leung) is killed in a politically motivated terrorist attack. He becomes obsessed with getting revenge, and he believes that a British government official, named Liam Hennessy (Brosnan), knows the identities of the killers. When Hennessy tells him he has no idea who the terrorists are, Quan won't take no for an answer. He begins terrorizing Hennessy, and his men, to get the information.  Having grew up on Jackie Chan movies, I used to be a huge fan of his. This is not a typical Chan film, more like a Liam Neeson revenge flick, with a Tom Clancy vibe to it. Which is totally cool in my book, plenty of action, and great fight scenes. It's also cool that he's such a sympathetic antihero, who does a lot of bad things in this film. Plus Brosnan is good too, and Campbell is a very effective director for this. It's definitely worth seeing, especially if you're a fan of Jackie Chan (or used to be).",3,12,0,"1,210","1,830",11-Dec-17,rated-7

Aaaaaand then things seem to largely forget about Jackie Chan and begin focusing on a mildly watchable ‘Troubles’ thriller where Pierce Brosnan gives his best performance alongside a blind-siding incest plotline. The strength of its central thesis (nationalism is never clean in a multi-cultural world) ebbs and flows throughout, and is of course strongest when Chan is allowed to express a similar beleaguered sadness behind his kind eyes, much like his surprisingly revelatory turn in The Karate Kid. It’s just a shame that the film isn’t disciplined enough to tighten up the political procedural part of the narrative and let Chan bust heads and cry a lot. Still though, it is idiosyncratic, and that goes a long way nowadays.",1,8,0,815,"4,646",26-Dec-17,rated-6

The pre-title card sequence is actually pretty effective in building tension, but The Foreigner takes an immediate dip after that. The decision to split this into two plots rather than just focusing on Jackie Chan's character was a poor one in my eyes, as the scenes with him are by far the best. He's a familiar character, a man with nothing left to lose, but he's gifted with some very interesting characteristics. There's a fairly ineffective dramatic irony in how no character accepts Jackie Chan as a valid threat, when we know as an audience that Chan is about to kick everyone's collective ass. It's not great filmmaking, nor is it an ideal popcorn movie. It's often slow-paced and politically driven for reasons I don't understand. The action scenes are wild, but they're almost more humorous than they are exciting. This is far too long of a review from someone who only caught an hour of this movie, but based on that much, I'd place it in the 2.5-3 star range. I wanted Jackie Chan to kill me, but instead, he just kicked me around a bit. It's been a rough night.",3,13,2,228,"4,262",14-Oct-17,0

With that in mind, it could be argued that Martin Campbell's The Foreigner, with its depiction of an IRA splinter group commencing a new mainland bombing campaign is in poor taste, is ludicrously anachronistic, or is worryingly prescient in post Brexit Britain.  Anachronism is definitely something at play here, because The Foreigner often feels like the kind of thriller that would have played out back in the '90s off the back of Patriot Games and the like. What makes it topical however is the depiction of Pierce Brosnan as a former IRA soldier turned politician; that often controversial issue of just where the IRA ends and were Sinn Féin begins is explored at length in the film in the same way that it was following the death of Martin McGuinness last year. Ultimately however, I'm just not really convinced by the IRA resurgence or their aims here. The late, great Ken Campbell believed that Jackie Chan was the greatest living actor of his generation (this opinion was reached during a seance in which Campbell asked the spirit of Sir Laurence Olivier who was the greatest actor currently out there!) and it's fair to say that, as Chan gets older, he's showcasing more and more of his acting chops as the stunt work clearly becomes less feasible for the sixty-four year old action star. The Foreigner is certainly no exception; as a grieving and sullen father seeking revenge for the murder of his daughter, Chan certainly convinces. There are moments at the immediate start of the film where you suspect Chan is going to play not only his age, but a somewhat everyman figure; an aging, mild mannered family man based in London, and I think Campbell elicits a fine performance from him. This is all a bluff of course as, once Chan commences his vendetta and his particular skillset with violence becomes more and more apparent, its revealed that he was in a former life a US trained special forces soldier, just like everyone always is in these kind of films. This plot development allows for the kinetic action set pieces that Chan has built his career upon to take place of course, although the use of CGI and stunt doubles are much more noticeable now. They're still rollicking fun of course, but the real plus to this film is when Chan really is acting - playing a deeply hurt man lost in both a sea of grief and vengeance - and a world away from his usual high-kicking comic screen persona. Speaking of acting, anyone who has ever read me banging on at length here about how poor I found his Bond films will know I'm not a huge fan of Pierce Brosnan, however his performance here ranks among his very best and is certainly on a par with the one in The Tailor of Panama. Fellow Irishman Dermot Crowley also delivers some strong support as a warring lieutenant and the pair get to snarl and explode at one another in several tense dialogue heavy scenes. Sometimes these politically-conscious sequences feel like they belong in a different, more realistic movie and we have to remind ourselves that Jackie Chan is hiding out in the woods somewhere going full-Rambo. It's that kind of strange movie really, it doesn't always come together and it sometimes feels like it needs a kick up the arse, but its not a waste of time by any stretch and is nowhere near as offensive as 'imagine Jackie Chan taking on the IRA' sounds. The film is based on the book The Chinaman (published in 1992, so that's why it feels so anachronistic!) by thriller novelist Stephen Leather and Chan's character is referred to by this eponymous description throughout, so it's rather surprising that the film chooses to call itself The Foreigner instead. I get that it's more PC, but the title sort of comes out of nowhere.",5,15,2,722,"3,038",18-Aug-18,rated-6

Following a street bombing that kills his daughter among other innocent Londoners, Ngoc Minh Quan (played by Chan) a Chinese Nùng and former Vietnam War special operations forces soldier vows revenge and answers to the perpetrators, self-identified as a group called “the authentic IRA.” He seeks out Northern Ireland deputy First Minister Liam Hennessy (Brosnan), who many years ago had ties to the IRA during The Troubles and its terrorist campaign in and around Belfast. Quan sees Hennessy as knowing much more about the bombing than he lets on, and much like the IRA used terrorism as a means to an end, Quan makes for a complicated protagonist with a dark edge from a history of pain. When Hennessy finds out Quan’s violent past, he realizes he underestimated him. In a film with very few if any good guys, Chan and Brosnan make for an interesting cat-and-mouse game that's not the usual action thriller. Oh yeah, and there are fights and stunts. No it's not Police Story, Rumble in the Bronx, or even Rush Hour, but for a man in his 60s, Chan is still really amazing.  As far as the story, it gets a little repetitive, even though it's a nice twist on the revenge thriller film. Chan is great, and even if it's a cool against-type role it's also just slightly more one-note with him yelling “the names!” at a bunch of Irishmen hoping he'll find who the terrorists are. The first act of the film is really good, but it doesn't improve from there. Also, there's a wildly ridiculous and sudden incest story? I'm sorry if that's a spoiler but I won't say who, and it's, uh, a strange choice.  Nevertheless, even through just a bit too much exposition, this is a fun movie that's dark in a morally ambiguous way. An eye for an eye certainly can make the whole world blind.

Playing against type in some fantastic roles, Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan shine in Martin Campbell's 'The Foreigner,' a political, twist-driven revenge thriller with some impressive, well edited fight sequences, lots of explosions, uncertain character loyalties and some rather tight pacing. The proceedings may seem a bit convoluted upon your first viewing, with some characters entering and exiting the film through long breaks, making it hard to keep up with who's who, but once things become clearer, the twists deliver a punch and the excitement and intensity is ramped up even further. This is easily the best film and performance from all three men in the last 10 or 15 years, with Jackie playing a straight-laced ex-soldier haunted by his past and out for gritty revenge, and Brosnan also appearing as an ex-soldier, one who is foul-mouthed with uncertain allegiances and possible enemies at every turn. These are the types of films where Campbell really shines in his directorial abilities, having impressed audiences worldwide with his work on 'Goldeneye' and 'Casino Royale' in the James Bond series, making this a proper reunion for him and Brosnan. He knows how to keep things tight and engaging, the cinematography he employs always feels clear-sighted and fresh, and damn, he sure knows how to shoot an action sequence, whether it's a bombastic explosion, a gunfight in tight quarters, or even a frenzied knife fight out in the woods. Speaking of the action, I do wish the film employed a bit more of it, because it really shines during those aforementioned moments. Still, when it's on, it's really on, and I also appreciate the twisty, uncertain nature of the story, the particular nastiness of the characters, the cool soundtrack, the actors playing uncommon roles and the overall political excitement.

So it's safe to say I was mostly left out on all the homages to Chan's celebrated career, and watched this movie as someone who didn't feel anything when seeing Chan again. But even beyond those contextual aspects, this is a rock-solid movie. A political thriller featuring bits of martial arts goodness; it begins with Chan's daughter being killed by a rogue IRA bomber in London. After mourning her loss and seeing no progress in the capturing of the bombers, he takes it upon himself to terrorize the bureaucratic systems into finding results and cutting through politics. In all honesty, Pierce Brosnan was the MVP for me in this. He kills it as the leader of a reformed, politically driven IRA; and as Chan's sort-of victim throughout the film. There's a surprising depth to the story here, many layers to peel back that Chan's character doesn't even factor in to. The writing is astute and well-paced, and the action never felt misplaced despite it being far from the center of the film. I really enjoyed this one.

Once again, the crowd at a theatrical experience I was at wasn't great, and thus I wanted to break the noses of several people but in actuality I just stared them down as I walked out of the auditorium at the movie's end. Anyhow, last night I saw this movie's premiere. I was interested; as the movie's marketing stressed, Jackie Chan would be appearing in a film getting a wide release in the United States for the first time in a long while; in fact, if you discount a movie I always will presume is atrocious (the Karate Kid remake) it's been almost a solid decade. Plus, judging by the trailers he was doing some acts you'd expect from a villain. I realize he was mad because Pierce Brosnan was not giving him help he thought he'd be able to give in the wake of Jackie's daughter dying in a London bombing attack but it was still a surprise as at least in the past 40 years he has turned down roles-including those in Hollywood films-where he'd be the villain as he only wanted to be seen as the hero in China. As this is brand new I won't spoil anything important, or who should be considered the heroes and villains in this movie. I'll just mention that while it's explained in the movie, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) is an important plot point. I am old enough to remember them but I imagine some of you have no idea. Basically, in the latter half of the 20th century there were extremely violent clashes over a segment of the population wishing Northern Ireland would not be a part of the United Kingdom and instead be united with the Republic of Ireland. In addition, Chan was in his early 60's when he made this movie so it's no surprise he doesn't do his astounding martial arts like he used to (or with such frequency); that said, what you do see is still entertaining, plus it's a nice change of pace for me to see him act and emote. This isn't great and some aspects of the plot can certainly be questioned. Even then, I thought this was a good time; as I heard someone else mentioned, the style of this and even the musical score will remind you of a certain crime drama director. I understand this is based on an early 90's book (which explains the IRA elements) and that is also why Jackie is playing a Vietnamese man; he was a producer on this so he was OK with playing a different nationality. The story doesn't always mesh well together but I can still say I was entertained by this picture.",4,7,2,"1,222","1,028",13/10/17,rated-6

Vietnamese immigrants run Chinese restaurants, former IRA terrorists refuse to fear the emasculated Asian lead, and the deadly conflict (despite everyone's decision to focus their attention on a mourning father) squarely rests inside of the United Kingdom. The title gives this away too. Chan is far less of a foreigner than any member of the IRA; people who patently refuse to align with Britain. The fact that the British government is also presented in a negative light only further amplifies that Campbell isn't picking sides in the conflict for Northern Irish independence. Campbell's film is one of identity, and how greatly our ethnic makeup determines how seriously we are taken: as men seeking justice, as lonely immigrants, as action stars. Yes, THE FOREIGNER is clumsily written, doesn't quite satisfy the way it ought to, and ends with a literal bang, but not with an emotional one. And still, I can't help but commend the effort put into subverting the War on Terror. It's frustrating that the casting of Chan is at both times the films greatest calling card and its woke eyesore, but as a piece on post-Brexit Britain, populist movements, and the failure to unite people in an era of division, it's excellent. There are no blockbusters that are this politically prescient, and though THE FOREIGNER might register as a little obtuse for American viewers, it'll find some recognition within the United Kingdom.

""The Foreigner"" places Chan, an ageing action hero, in a role as a grieving father who after peacefully searching for identities of the bombers, a rogue faction of the IRA or UDA as they're known in the film, and being politely told to stay out of the investigation by both Scotland Yard and the political leader of the Irish Republicans played by Pierce Brosnan, chooses to actively involve himself and reveals that he was previously a Vietnamese special ops soldier trained by the Americans. The violent state of the world has screwed him over good both in the past and now, and he's had enough. He's definitely got a Charles Bronson thing going which is quite convincing. The setting in Northern Ireland and London look quite expertly done. Brosnan is maybe even more convincing as a political leader wishing to achieve the goals of the militant wing of a unified Ireland but without the blood of innocents as the price. This film got pretty heavy as the rogue violence perpetrated by the splinter group spreads to everyone, with executions coming down hard and heavy, man or woman.PS: My reference to UDA was incorrect. UDA, the Ulster Defense Association was or is a militant loyalist group in Northern Ireland, totally opposed to the goal of the IRA (Irish Republican Army) to unify the north with the rest of Ireland. I should have said the Authentic IRA, not UDA. They're on totally opposite sides. Sorry for the confusion.",1,15,2,198,562,19/8/18,rated-8
The Foreigner,2017,113,action,thriller, , ,24534,7 fans,3.12,104,317,493,2010,3186,7829,6157,3428,522,488," After a disastrous foray into costumed buffoonery, Martin Campbell returns to his strengths in a film that reunites him with Goldeneye's Pierce Brosnan, while acting as an age appropriate starring vehicle for Jackie Chan. The Foreigner is not a film without issues.  Cliff Martinez's score while a charming example of the 80s wannabe synth pop that is all the rage today, has nothing to do with the films subject matter, being especially out of place during the Forrest sequences.  The cast is all excellent, but with only a handful of character actors - it makes the IRA seem very small.  With only one character actor amongst Brosnan's colleagues, its little doubt who the rogue faction answers to.  These problems are largely superficial, with the biggest barricade to my enjoyment coming from an underlying misogyny.  From an unpleasant choice of torture victim in the final act, to a bizarre choice to make up an actress in her thirties to look much older to act as a love interest for the sixty three year old Chan, the brief appearances by women don't go well. The Foreigner isn't the film it could have been, but it's still a strong return from Martin Campbell, giving Brosnan better material than he's worked with in years, and stands as one of Chan's strongest American pictures.",3,7,0,290,447,7-Nov-17,rated-6

You'll be hard pressed to find someone who's as obsessed with the Cheetah Girls canon as I am. I own all of the lore books, I own 7 copies of each film on the criterion collection, and I have all of the scripts memorized in 30 different languages including Latin.  So with all that said, I was utterly mortified to hear that Oz Scott would not be returning to direct the sequel of the original Cheetah Girls. That was the case until I heard that the cinematic God himself, Kenny Ortega, would be hailing the project. Imagine orgasming 100 times at once while high on heroin, that's how I felt once the news reached my ears. The Cheetah Girls 2: When in Spain may very well be the crowning jewel of Kenny Ortega's filmography. When their assassination of the Venezuelan president goes awry in the first film, the Cheetah Girls have no choice but to flee to Spain. When Kenny Ortega was asked, ""Why Spain?"" he responded: ""Spain is on the verge of becoming a commie hell scape, I feel obligated as a filmmaker to bring awareness to this issue and to save all innocents from Marxism. I hope all pinkos rot in the hottest and humidest depth of hell for all eternity, right next to that mother fucker Mao."" Kenny would regularly get into heated debates over what direction the film should take with the producer, Whitney Houston. Whitney thought a film about the Cheetah Girls shouldn't be so ""politically charged"" but Kenny wholeheartedly disagreed. Hollywood rumor has that one day Kenny showed up to set with a bomb strapped to his chest.  ""I'm a man with a vision, I'm a man who's here to make sure the men who died on Hill 875 didn't make that sacrifice in vain. If you wanna obstruct the truth, then go right the fuck ahead Whitney, but don't think I'm not bringing you miserable cunts down to hell with me."" Luckily the cast and crew were able to talk Kenny down, though sadly it wouldn't be the last time. Kenny attempted suicide several times during production, fortunately though he was saved every time. If Kenny Ortega isn't a man who suffers for his art, then I don't know how anyone else could.",8,6,0,144,115,9/12/19,rated-10

I'm upset that the only conflict lasted for exactly 3 minutes but it also gave us ""It's Over"" and Raven's love interest wasn't hot but he gave us ""Strut"" so all is forgiven. Somehow, Raven wears a topless Hat with almost every outfit. Most of the places this sequel fails are under Kenny Ortega's direction that doesn't fit the Cheetah tone, and in the writers writing towards each performer's strengths, rather than anything having to do with character (I'm 21 years old and I'm writing a character analysis on The Cheetah Girls I want to die). The first movie tried to paint authentic girls with gigantic, wide strokes. It feels like young girls naturally speaking and living with dreams the movie can acknowledge they won't succeed at but the girls still believe they can. This one makes caricatures of those same girls and then pushes them even further by making those impossible dreams come true. The other glaring issue is its clumsy play around diegetic music. The original exclusively literally performed numbers. Every song in this one, though, has a confused, unnecessary mix.Thank you for Golan Yosef and giving us a beautiful little twink to inspire to (he has grown into an actually-gay beautiful twunk- instagram.com/p/BOhByM_Dfo5/).

Though my family is not Spanish (Costa Rican, so they do speak the language), this film explores sexual abuse, death, and loneliness. Though my family does not have a history of sexual abuse (as far I know), the elements regarding the death of Irene (Carmen Maura) and her return to care for her sister and how she appears to her daughters to tie up loose ends, is entirely moving. On my Costa Rican side, the one I am far closer with, my mother and her seven sisters lost their mother back in the 1990s. I do not remember her, but they often speak of her, the food she made, and how she will often appear to them in dreams. As far as I know, she is not appearing to right any wrongs, but all the same, I can see the parallels. Similarly, most have had some rough histories with men from abuse, adultery, or pure laziness. Thus, the complaints regarding abuse (sexual in the film) and adultery by the women in this film also further hits home. All told, Volver was a film made for my enjoyment and Pedro Almodovar knocked it out of the park. My second film from him, this is a welcomed film after All About My Mother was good, but left me feeling cold. Volver is very much the opposite with brilliant direction, acting, and a heartfelt and thoroughly moving story. Part magic realism, tragedy, and farce, Volver has a bit of an absurd plot at times, but can be boiled down to: a woman, Irene, comes to visit her two daughters, Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) and Soledad (Lola Duenas). Initially taking care of her dying sister (her daughter's aunt), Irene is here to make amends with Raimunda. Though she was always tight with Soledad, Raimunda had drifted away from her in her teens for reasons unknown to her. However, upon Irene's death, she learns why and shows up to make amends. Initially nervous to see her, Raimunda eventually finds out her mother is with Soledad anyways and what ensues is a phenomenal finale to the film. The final quarter of the film is the strongest section without question as it is the most emotional portion. In particular, the final line where Raimunda is excited to have her mother back and finally gets to talk to her, absolutely ruined me. Thinking of my mother and aunts when they merely get to see their mother in a dream, it was very easy for me to fall in love with this section of the film and the film as a whole. This power of the mother-daughter relationship is the real strength of this film. While watching the scenes in the restaurant between Raimunda and the film crew, I was confused as to how it played into the film as a whole. Obviously, there is great comedy as there is someone hidden in the freezer in the back, but her success and camaraderie with the crew does not add much. That is, of course, until she decides to sing. In the scene with the musicians on the crew and her singing a song that her mother taught her, while her mother is hiding from her in a car, is incredible. Moving, emotional, and powerful, the emotion is clear on both the faces of Cruz and Maura. They really nail this scene and make it one of the most powerful definitions of the relationship between two. Even more, the song itself is about the memories and pain a person carries with them at night that keeps them awake. The connection to the plot and hidden pasts of the characters is clear, which makes the song a tremendous selection and the scene as a whole becomes truly wondrous. In full transparency, I always love films about death. I am probably weird, but they are always so moving and powerful. Volver is no exception and underscores why good films about the subject work so well. The film underscores the feelings of loneliness, grieving, and healing, people go through. The film also really underscores the beauty of life, in spite of pain, and the beauty of death, in spite of the reason. Death is not be feared, but here, it shows this odd beauty as well as the darkness it can create, or turns it into comedy. This may seem odd, but it does work quite well for Volver and Almodovar assures that the moments are given their due weight. After not loving my first entry in his filmography, Volver made me understand the love for Pedro Almodovar. Moving, emotional, and powerful, Volver's great accomplishment is its mother-daughter relationship, the regret, death, and lost time. Thanks to terrific acting, directing, and writing, Volver really hits home at times and is a truly tremendous experience. Though occasionally slow and a little bloated in spots, the finale and overall film make these flaws incredibly easy to look past.",6,12,0,894,"1,997",6-Jan-17,rated-9

The Skin I Live In had a great first half and then dropped in quality but Volver improved as it went on. The story is kinda hard to explain but it focuses on family dynamics of three generations of women. Partly why I can’t get into Almodovar films is because he has such weird topics and characters are taken out of proportions. The production and acting has been good but whether it is the culture or something else, it somehow feels little off. This had those elements but the story arc is much compelling than in Nervous Breakdown and Skin I Live In. It’s not too focused on any specific relationship, though Penelope Cruz is the lead, and this gave a lot of breathing room to get to know different characters and to think about what Almodovar is trying to say. His melodrama sometimes gets tedious but because the narrative is open ended he was able to keep my attention. The closure was satisfying and I’m starting to warm up for his twisty narrative structure. Things are in a turning point for Cruz’s Raimunda as people around her die and something from the past returns to visit. This theme of past problems getting closure is done many times but the setting Almodovar has is unique to me. He seems to have had some experiences with this kind of superstition, sickness and death because these things come across very natural and day to day even when there basically is a ghost from beyond the grave. It gave somewhat supernatural feeling - not in a scary but more hopeful way. Giving a chance to redeem your past actions, to make amends with someone you had a fall out. It made me think how I behave. What is my relationship like with my parents and what more would I like to know about them? (It’s fitting today is Father’s Day in many Nordic Countries). Bright colors like red jumped out of the screen and Almodovar aptly used wide variety of tunes from different genres.

There's always been elements of soap opera running through what are usually very melodramatic films and Volver sees the director embrace this aspect, just as he embraces the Hollywood genres that inspire his own work and the result is high art in the guise of low art⁠—the story may be daytime TV level but nothing else about the production is. There's the usual perfectly blended comedy and tragedy, eye-popping use of vibrant colour and just when you think this might be a straight-forward family drama he throws in one of his sensational narrative twists that spices things up in a very Goodfellas kind of way and throws you off the scent entirely. Almodóvar knows how to get a laugh but he also understands that comedy alone isn't enough to sustain a film—it needs a dramatic backbone to maintain our interest and being very much an actors director, his talented troupe of performers are more than able to do both. I didn't think it was possible to have a bigger crush on Penélope Cruz than I already had but now here we are; she's just amazing, with perfect comedic timing, emotional range and nuance that lights up every scene, even outshining the likes of co-star Carmen Maura. For a filmmaker whose work so frequently brushes with dark themes and flirts with taboo topics there's an incredible maturity on display, his style now so refined that art and entertainment are now inseparable. This wildly unpredictable story of three very different women at various stages in their lives is fun and quirky but also anchored in life-affirming reality and relatability without ever finding the need to be sentimental about it.

I should be thankful I started with this one because god damn is it impressive. I can only hope that the rest of Almodovar's work comes close to being as good as this.

It's got its faults, but as a lesson in tonal shifts and cinematography, it's really quite astounding. It's a testament to Pedro Amoldovar's directing skills-- the disparate plot points, the counterintuitive combination of subjects, and the contrasting tones are a lot to juggle, but he handles them masterfully, creating a patchwork quilt of weirdness and beauty. This will be a difficult one to forget. Part of the movie's charm stems from its numerous plot twists, each of which take the tone in a different direction, so I'll avoid summarizing the story. Let's just say that the film is about a single mother named Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) whose mother returns from the dead after many years. The film also includes plot threads involving cancer, rape, incest, arson, murder, child abandonment, and general trauma. Oh, and cooking! :D It's hard to believe that a story this objectively dark can be told in such a genuinely charming way. But rarely does the film lose its footing, keeping the tone melancholy yet lighthearted. Like the films of Wes Anderson, it tackles rough topics in a way that both softens the blow and provides for some interesting stylistic choices. The color scheme is eye-popping without being garish, the cinematography is brisk, and the movie asserts itself so confidently it's hard to question any of the major directorial choices. Amoldovar understands this world, and he wastes none of our time establishing its eccentricities through exposition. He drops us straight in. Watching this film is like wandering through a foreign country-- Amoldovar is our guide, and while we don't know what to expect, we're counting on him to make it worth our while. More often than not, he succeeds.  It's no easy task, either. There are plenty of films out there about day-to-day life in small European towns (Cinema Paradiso, L'Avventura, and the aforementioned Amarcord come to mind). But there's a fine line between the authentic charm of these films and the concocted schmaltz that permeates movies like 2000's Chocolat, which also takes place in a tiny European village. When movies like this succeed, it's because their narrative thrust mirrors what life is like in the places they depict. Volver features no rushed plotting, no forced or sudden narrative developments-- it moves along at a leisurely pace that's immensely satisfying. Cruz is excellent as Raimunda. The character is deeply flawed, but the movie is about her coming to terms with that, and her can-do attitude towards life is very endearing. Whether it's cooking a meal for fifty people with only a few hours of warning, taking care of her daughter, or hiding her husband's dead body in a freezer, she approaches the task with a presence of mind that is admirable. Things don't exactly fall into a neat little bundle for her at the end, though we do come to understand some of the decisions she made and how her experiences shaped her personality. There is one small plot-related detail that I might nitpick, which has to do with abuse perpetuating itself from one generation to the next, but I will not get into that here. For all I know, it's a wholly realistic phenomenon.  The film is also consistently funny, ranging from outright farcical humor to moments where we question whether we should be laughing or not. It's just the right mix of lighthearted and morbid humor, but even then it's hardly classifiable as a ""dark"" comedy. There's just too much life to it, and the characters are too optimistic, even in the face of ridiculous adversity. As a whole, the film is surprisingly uplifting despite its gruesome subject matter, and it never attempts to exploit any of these subjects for emotional manipulation purposes (Lovely Bones, anyone?). It's a whimsical tale about some truly horrific elements of humanity. Volver isn't perfect, but it's a triumph of deeply personal filmmaking that is both highly unique and intelligently made. I intend to look into the rest of Amoldovar's filmography in the near future, starting with the film ""All About My Mother.""

What made this story unique for me was how naturally Almodóvar made a film that revolves around strong-willed women;  usually, films that do this in contemporary times feel forced.   I know people love Penélope Cruz here, and I for one was in awe by the scene where she sings, but I personally was struck by Lola Dueñas's performance in this one for some inexplicable way.

Come 2006, Almodovar's latest films were guaranteed an art cinema release around the world, and an ostensible women's pic from him featuring a more adult role transition from Penelope Cruz was preordained to get the kind of attention that some of his earlier films just didn't. I like the more lowkey soap tone Almodovar has gone for here. Some of the riches lie in what is unsaid or muted, such as the body in the freezer suggesting a restaurant cannibalism gag. I also enjoyed with recognition how the mother coming to stay is read as the daughter hoarding all her keepsakes. Much lies between the margins, most symbolically in the self-repudiating penitent existence of the ghost. Feels like a sly dig at how female activities escape the perception and valuation of a more paternal scrutiny, such as their labour, their discretion in the presence (and memory) of men and their private sisterhood investigating. All the men are dead and gone, just one more body to bury. One secret made, one secret shared. Quid pro quo. All the old occupations are here like gravedigging, prostitution, catering, singing, hairstyling, cleaning, secrecy, mourning, mistaken identity, etc. The key might be that sisterly sacrifice wins the day over saucy talkshow temptation or transference of burden. It holds back the scandalous public reveal and will carry the private dignity of continuing to be eaten up inside. If you feel alone, haunted by your sins, chances are your closest are doing much the same. Witnessing the selfless silent which escapes the chronicled. I'm sure Woody Allen could read some antiquity allusions into the telenovela veneer.

It's a story with heavyweight dramatic elements weaved into the everyday, incorporating things like murder, deception and the afterlife with much less substantial dilemmas like scheduling conflicts or an excess of errands. His characters approach these issues not with an emphasis on the metaphysical but with common sense, an ambivalence to the idea of being overwhelmed by the seemingly tedious obstacles life throws at them. Death and sorrow are taken in stride, never once hindering these women from accomplishing their day to day tasks. Those seeking a cinematic celebration of women need look no further than Volver , as Almodovar in his filmography seems to simply love women. But (seeing as Almodovar is gay), rather than focus on their attractiveness, utility, or romantic potential (as much of cinema does), he loves them for ferocity, for their vivaciousness and sensical approach to life. For their compassion, warmness and sturdiness. He seems to, in a way, be acknowledging the women who raised him, for their overheard gossiping, ambitions felt and compromises made, the comfort he once felt in their ability to take disaster in stride. This film is so warm, so domestic in it's use of color. Reds, yellows, greens, all vibrant and all essential. Even recurring visual motifs, like the constant emphasis of Penelope Cruz's cleavage or fanciful depictions of Spanish cuisine contribute to the overwhelmingly grace and domesticity of the film. It's a comedy that lightly delves into the dark psychology of the human mind, unpredictable in where the narrative will go but always grounded in a sort of soap-operaish comedy. It's fundamentally an exploration of the depths to be found within the bond between mother and daughter, with a fantastic element of magic realism along the way. Perhaps above all, it's wonderful to see Penelope Cruz perform in her own culture and language, for once used as something more than a sex object in an action film. She elevates Almodovar's already genius script substantially, thriving in her role as not only a maternal figure, but a strong woman Hollywood needs to take note of.",1,60,0,145,"4,873",7-Jan-16,rated-9

I struggle with the exaggeration and resist the emotion on the prejudicial grounds that it isn’t real enough. But I know from talking to my mum who loves Pedro Almodovar’s films and from occasional lapses in my defence mechanisms that when you do let yourself be swept away by a good one it can be a rich and wonderful experience. I almost got there with Volver. Its story is preposterous. It’s a lurid and sensational soap opera. And yet it manages to find emotional truths amidst its contrivances, and it overflows with love for its characters, and by extension, for women generally. It’s a film of big themes – family and community, absent and bad men, the resourceful and resolute women they leave behind, and of death.  I loved the scene with the women at the wake, dressed in black, fanning themselves, converging like a scrum to kiss one another. How could you not love these women? They are constantly kissing each other even in mourning. I loved the description of their town in La Mancha as having the highest rate of insanity in Spain because of the wind. I can relate to that living in Wellington, the windiest city on earth. I loved the score by Alberto Iglesias. It was a pleasure to hear it carry the story aloft with its subtle, gently immersive yet buoyant flow, supporting the pace and the drama without exaggeration. I think this is part of why Almodovar is such an enigma. His films are lurid and sensational in terms of colour and story, yet he can still find room for subtleties that are beguiling. What I loved most is the way the camera loves the characters. It cherishes them irrespective of their age. It brings out their deeper beauties whether they are a senile great grandma, a harried and industrious mother, or a distressed cancer patient: they are all made beautiful through the lens of the lives they live and the community they share. If only the plot was not so outrageous I would love this film more. On at least two occasions I thought Almodovar had taken things too far, only for another outrageous twist to be revealed. For me, Pain and Glory is easily his best film because its excesses are restrained. But maybe Volver’s point is that we should never be restrained in our adoration of women, to which I would say fair point.",8,15,7,191,506,5-Jan-20,rated-7

Well, that's not the case here because Almodovar knows what subtlety means. First off, Penelope Cruz! Even though she's awfully incredible wherever we see her on-screen, I deem her performance here the very best. She's juggling nuances like a chameleon on drugs.  Almodovar's beautifully glorifying the 'realness' of women who've managed to keep the sense of genuine goodness despite their ever-growing immorality as an answer to the society's never-changing gender issues. By mainly accentuating thereon, however, the Spanish filmmaker manifests the character's backstories in a botched, on-the-nose fashion which contrasts the breathtaking subtlety of the plot lines. The genuine inter-trust between the women is fascinating, but despite that, Cruz's character should've been more discreet in the way she executes the 'thing'.",3,14,0,107,515,6-Jul-20,rated-6

Volver quickly threw me off balance, not due to the shocking, dark, ridiculous story (ghosts, rape, murder, body disposals, numerous plot twists) but because of how calmly it tells it, bubbling with crowdpleasing charm despite often-horrific subject matter. I’m not sure I’ll ever jive with the sexual assault portions being portrayed so casually, but the disconnect between implausible melodrama and cool, colourful style is clearly an intentional and essential part of Almodovar’s voice, something that I’ll comprehend better when I’m more familiar with his filmography.

Almodóvar girls.They aren't particulary pretty, distinguished, or morally correct. They are original, free, sincere, passionate, reckless, stubborn, wild, strong, fighters, self-sufficient... and alone. But not in a bad way; they are the ones responsible of their fate, totally independent. And even if they rely on a masculine figure at first, these women will always find a way to break these ties and set free. I'm saying all this because I think Volver is the movie with the most ''Almodóvar'' group of women. As the director himself said: ''The film is about three generations of women who survive the wind, the fire, the madness, the superstition and even death based on kindness and boundless vitality.'' I don't know how I lived all these years without you. Volver is to return to the family and the roots we've left behind. I feel it so close to Hispanic culture when it tackles themes, traditions and beliefs we have about our deads. It's like magical realism, this movie gives it all a surrealist aura, but it also feels so beliavable and common.

I always seem to find myself deeply hooked into his films, an unhealthy yearning for the domestic lives of others, an intoxicating soap-opera that provides enough closure to achieve satisfaction for its audience. Soap-Opera dramas run for years, and people find themselves coming back because not just its over-bloated sense of drama but also a sense of hope that it would lead to a closure; writers banking on this sense of need by providing a tragic death and abuse in every corner in order to keep reeling its audience back in and to distract from the harsh truth that it would never end, people would come and go and play with our emotional strings, a sense of escapism that rarely stays too far from the truth. Almodovar is kind enough to provide his films a closure, mind you not the neatly tucked ones you would find in other films, the ones that closes a story but simultaneously by the end opens another one. He leaves the audience at a perfect time, one where we could let ourselves rest but also left wanting more. Volver’s blueprints are elements we have seen many times before, especially in an Almodovar film; he takes simple domestic stories, and blows them up to a point of almost fantasy, but as I have said earlier, far enough that we find ourselves in escape but close enough that its world and emotions feel all too familiar. It is in this sense of balance that makes Volver such a compelling film to watch. Raimunda (Penelope Cruz) is a mother and a wife, her relationship with her partner have been rough, even more so since he has recently lost his job. She works six days a week, and planning to pick up another one on her only free day in order to make up for her husband’s loss. Her husband, Paco (Antonio de la Torre), has incestual feelings for her daughter, Paula (Yohana Cobo), sometimes looking at her crotch or peeking on a slightly opened door whilst she is changing. One day Raimunda comes home from work, finding her daughter drenched and emotionally stricken at the bus stop; it is revealed that Paco attempted to rape his daughter and through self-defence, Paula stabbed him and has bled to death in their kitchen. What I have described is only one of the story elements that this film has to offer. It is now understood that in Almodovar’s films, things are not what they initially seem; a mystery is always lurking in its atmosphere that would ultimately be revealed later on. Even in anticipation, Almodovar still manages to surprise us, unable to make the connections because he withholds clues and critical information until it is the right time. Always it comes and shocks you, potentially changing the ways you would look at the story and its characters; a value that would be appreciated through subsequent viewings. Almodovar doesn’t cheat his audiences by providing a twist with no weight to anchor it, the revealed details are always within the rules of its world, it may change the way we look at the story but it never changes it, everything that has been built up before connects with its exposition, and delivers it with such emotional force that it hits you like a strike to the heart. The film’s themes of death, abuse, confession, and womanhood are on full display here. It seeps in between the drama, something for his audience to chew on as they travel through their daily lives. Almodovar uses superstition and culture as a way to push forward the film’s plot, while also building upon its character and world, we slowly understand its values in the character’s lives, adding a layer that makes the journey through Volver all the more convincing. It was in the theme of confession that make Volver such a fascinating story as its characters are stricken by the abuse and damage of men, leading its women to fight back, sometimes ending in drastic results; these become weight for these women to bear, a secret that they must keep for the benefit of themselves and those they love; but at the end, it states the importance of confession, a necessary ritual that must be undertaken to clear the conscience before passing away, possibly also to ensure their safe passage to heaven, as the Spanish culture is very religious and many of its characters are carrying heavy sins. I have always thought highly of Penelope Cruz, I am aware that her work in America doesn’t bring out the most of her range as an actress. Now that I have seen her perform in her native land and tongue during the height of skill as a performer, there is so much more passion found in her performance, a familiarity that allows her to dig in the deepest depths of her character and bringing them out through moments of subtlety and genuine emotion. Given that this is only the second Spanish film that I have seen from Cruz, the first being Jamon Jamon, and her other collaborations with Almodovar may have been far greater, but seeing her here has left a mark on me that I doubt her other films with Almodovar would be able to top. The film also brings out wonderful performances from Carmen Maura, Lola Duenas, and Blanca Portillo; playing complex female roles that never at a point stops being dramatically stimulating. Each actress perform their roles with an uneven, but appropriate, balance of drama and comedy; the former dominating almost every scene, ensuring that the characters are taken with seriousness especially during the film’s significant moments, while the comedy acts as a cushion and appears in the most unexpected of ways, the humour never over steps its boundaries and derives from its dialogue and small reactions from the cast, executed in such a way that still manages to keep in line with the film’s reality. Volver is an outstanding the film that has the potential of becoming one of my favourite films from the Spanish director, it is simply melodrama at its finest; a balance in craft that hooks you in, ending with an emotional peak, and leaves you wanting more.

It is Almodóvar’s ultimate stab to the oppression of the patriarchy, whose female victims disregard hate as their tool for survival. Rather these women use resilience, music, trust, love, and friendship to withstand life’s misfortunes. Operating from the strength of its all-female cast led by the stupendous Penelope Cruz, Volver is indeed, a gorgeous treat. As a film, Volver doesn’t break any new conventions. Instead it rehashes all the things that Almodóvar is great at doing. Different storylines converge into one, mysteries unfold, a musical sequence, vibrant decors, and a bizarre crime scene that will help churn everything out. Volver is also Almodóvar’s tribute to the ancient ways of life, histories and customs where he builds a big statement of how it is difficult to maintain respect to the past while being able to sustain ourselves at the present time. Volver is a true women’s picture where women use their own intellect, and emotions to survive as men are perceived as useless, and powerless. For that, I truly respect it. The acting is marvelous. Penelope Cruz (in the best performance of her career) displays her range and depth as an actress in her native-speaking language. Cruz is sensuous, passionate, and true earth mother personified, reminiscent of the early Sophia Loren and Anna Magnani. The film also proved to be a homecoming for muse Carmen Maura who returns working with Almodóvar, with a mysterious, irresistible performance. The rest of the ensemble which includes Yohana Cobo, Blanca Portillo, Lola Duenas, and Chus Lampreave marked such bold, great impressions. Overall, Volver is lovely and empowering. It is one of Almodóvar’s best and arguably his most accessible film for any starters with his cinema.",4,24,4,"2,295","1,599",20-Jun-17,rated-9

To the beauty, sacrifice, pain & hurt that a woman lives with. To the mother and the daughter and also to every single one that follows. To the past, to the present and to the afterlife. It's a sprinkling and colorful, yet immensely gentle, entity of emotional connections between what makes and breaks a family. In Pedro's film there are a lot of things happening. On the center is a story of daughters & mothers. One that is as strong as the happiness on a Sunday afternoon & as sad and melancholic as the loved ones death day.  Volver is a film that sails through with great charm, common sense and an eye to make things work again!

A tender and beautiful film about people (all women) being there for each other. There are many twists and turns throughout, but it never feels convoluted. One particular moment of conflict between two characters literally resolves itself in the next scene - it's so refreshing to see people just forgive each other rather than hold grudges to inject some drama into the proceedings. The other Almodóvar films I've seen have had a similar humane quality, but I found them a little too knowing; their self-conscious preoccupation with the conventions of the melodramatic form got in the way of my appreciation for the characters as real people. Here, that's no issue. Every relationship is rich and every motivation clear. Almodóvar strikes the perfect balance between a heartfelt and honest story and something altogether more heightened and more enchanting than real life.

Almodovar's filmmaking does not generally lend itself to the kind of solemn, quiet contemplation I've been doing since my arrival here, yet this affected me. The collision of family, history, and interpersonal turmoil has been on my mind since I got off the plane, and this movie deals powerfully with all three themes in ways that are not obvious or overstated. Everything Almodovar does here clicks with me in a way the other films of his that I've seen haven't. The performances are so complete and human, the settings are vibrant and lively in the way I'd always heard his movies were supposed to be. The editing gives the conflicts weight and allows us to feel what the characters feel, whether it be dread, pride, joy, etc. It's empathetic directing that gives us an insight into these people and what drives them in the face of pain and adversity, without ever feeling false. Since arriving here, I've seen castles, countless paintings and statues by long-dead masters, skeletons from centuries ago, a lake built from the collisions of countless glaciers over centuries, a camera obscura older than America, and a tiny chapel dating back nearly a thousand years. But this might be the artifact that's affected me the most in my time here: something contemporary from a place I've never seen or been, something I could have watched at home.",3,7,3,93,87,8-Aug-19,rated-10

The only way to really begin a dialogue regarding Jordan Peele's Get Out - a surrealistic and searing Buñuel horror show - is to observe its final image and ponder the implications. Composed of flashing police lights dissipating into a tunnel of darkness while a woman is bleeding fast towards the finality of death, its basic informational grammar, taken without context, visualizes defiant (or oblivious) law enforcement in the face of a serious, life-or-death situation. If you were to take this image and present it to various individuals, the reaction would be a uniform one: ""why is the police car driving away from an active crime scene? Isn't someone in need of assistance?""  Taken with context, with all necessary background knowledge witnessed, the real question is: ""why didn't Chris kill Rose?""  It's a scene laced with thorns. When the police car first arrives, what did I think? ""Oh, how is he going to explain this to the police officer?!"" I figured Peele was yanking the fantasy right out of our guts, forcing an audience to realize violence's inherent grimness even when surrounded by devious racists and a sinister aura of appropriation, but the truth was like being prodded by a cow iron. Seeing Rod - played to perfection by LilRel Howery - step out of the driver's seat was equal in sight to an angel in the nighttime; a scene so unearthly that previous visions of a hypnotic limbo feel gravitated to reality. My mostly white audience breathed a collective sigh of relief, but the switcheroo on Peele's part is of greater agency than a thrill (although it undoubtedly succeeds). It provides an empathetic meeting place where common ground can be felt across a silver screen and a packed genre crowd; in this moment, Get Out teaches.  And it doesn't only teach about the idea of what we perceive and how such a notion may be constructed due to staggering systemic racial divisions in 2017's America, but that the thought is *shared*. We continue to live in a society where the combination of a police car and a black citizen inherently alludes to confrontation, violence, arrest, oppression, and yet, the real, and sad, truth is found in how Peele can grasp a situational example of ethnic tension and multipurpose it into a thrill which anyone can comprehend. Starting with this moment, a culmination of dubious cogency, feels like the only logical way to write about such a waking nightmare of a film - feverish, witty, sharp as a deer's antlers - because it both begins and ends with us, the public, the American people.  It begins with us as detached; constructing a premise where the 'white liberal' racist tendencies and lingering, stuffy quirks are subtle in their conversational awareness. You've probably heard age-old generational stories showcasing long-term familial connection with other ethnicities or persisting political issues which only seem to be mentioned for a nod by the receiving party. Maybe you've even been on the suffering end, maybe you've even said such things, but the specificity ends there. Get Out is here to probe these memories - whether personal or collective or cultural - out of you and say: look, it's all around you, and it's in Everywhere, USA, no less.  But it ends with us having experienced something divided in a divided time yet the audience has been sharing an examination of the Black Experience. Everyone, in every theater in every city and town, is on the same page, witnessing commodification based around racial Myth and devious, harrowing ignorance found under the living rooms of the rich only to fester in the hearts of communities. Get Out is not a film which ends with America metaphorically holding hands, but it is representative of the divide which still casts a shadow across this land and how whiteness continues to own the prospects and attributes of the black body. Rose being left for dead by Chris, deciding not to kill her - an ingenious, unspoken visual image of black command - isn't the only aspect that sets a volatile message aflame. It's that Chris did nothing wrong.  All for now. Probably more after a rewatch. Formally, structurally, conceptually; a masterpiece of American horror.",9,729,25,512,"30,140",25-Feb-17,rated-10

Instead I will simply note the parts that I especially liked (and the one thing I hated): The moment Chris is told that what the man who bought him at slave auction wants from him is his eyes drives home the intention to capture as many facets of the way whiteness treats black people as commodities. The film flashes (heavy-handedly, sigh) to the objectifying actions of each of the prospective buyers, but the one who bought him is the one who wants his eyes, driving home yet another metaphor (white consumption of black talent) that seems especially apt in a film that made over $250 million in a white country; it quietly asserts that even if you're enjoying, appreciating, paying for this film, you are still part of the exploitative process. (Unless, of course, you aren't.) The overall plot also addresses a fundamental fact: race is not about skin color. It's not biological. It's a social construct, and whiteness is not a race but a loyalty to the hegemony of white supremacist capitalism. White minds appropriating black bodies is very directly shown here in insidious science fiction, a metaphor that encapsulates whiteness on multiple levels, but woven into the story are a thousand references to institutional discriminations and the very real state violence against black people. Disbelief, gaslighting, experimentation, manipulation, and literal harvesting happens to black bodies. In the film, this is done on a direct, personal level, and it reflects--as I have read many times--real personal experiences, but it also reflects a larger, systemic oppression wherein all of those things are done to black bodies on a mass scale. It's part of our history, part of the fuel of capitalism. There's a scene where Georgina apologizes for unplugging Chris's phone, and the camera keeps switching back and forth between Chris and Georgina. Chris is filmed from a medium close up, his neck and face visible, full expressions, mostly confusion, fear, frustration. Georgina is filmed very close up, Demme-close-up, and her facial expressions are that rigid, uncanny blankness that characterizes the assimilated black people of this film. The camera is just slightly beneath her face, the lighting making her skin seem perfectly smooth. A single tear streams down her face and some emotion struggles to come through, but it's locked behind this mask that we later learn is the dominance of whiteness. It's the one moment in the film that was thoroughly unnerving, pitching the viewer outside of reality entirely, a potent illustration of the horror of being locked in one's own body. Removing even the racial implications, this is a moment of horror, but with them, it's devastating. The part I hated, though, is the theatrical ending. Making the ending a moment of comedy and giving a heroic rescue to a member of TSA, even if that's part of the humor to the moment, is a glaring disconnection from the role of TSA in U.S. racist violence, an oblivious copout that undermines the film's themes. The alternative ending (which I had to find online because the DVD didn't work right?) was much stronger and eerier, more tonally in keeping with the film, and its more realistic nature a stronger concluding statement. The feelgood ending smacks of studio interference, no matter what they're saying in the interviews. October count: 4/31",6,220,13,792,"13,950",2-Oct-17,0

The film is genuinely creepy. Instead of cheesy music and grotesque torture, Peele relies on the unknown to draw you in. What is happening here? The plot builds like a slow boil to a terror explosion. Clues to the outcome are noticeable from the first second, but it takes the entire run-time of the film to pull everything together. It's such a joy to be surprised by a horror outcome. The ending is truly satisfying. My favorite aspect of Get Out is the intelligence of the characters. There's a lot to like, but beyond the deeper themes, the characters aren't morons (like your typical horror/scary movie). I cringe every time I watch a genre film, and the characters don't behave logically. Chris and Rose are not fools. Something is wrong, enough to warrant caution. Anyone in this situation would be alarmed as events play out. Credit again to Peele for writing characters that act rationally. Michael Abel's score is haunting yet subtle. It stays in tune with the culture and slowly builds up towards the horror themes. ""Get Out"" doesn't replace the scares with humor – Peele is too smart to do that. Instead, he balances the fear with laughs and then combines everything with social comment and that unsettling tone. The fact that Chris is so highly likable just underlines it.

In his 1946 essay, “Politics and the English Language,” Orwell decried the sorry state of English writing—mostly political writing, though other types as well—and offered by way of corrective a set of six rules, including the following: (1) “Never use a long word where a short one will do”; and (2) “If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.” It is hard to be as good a writer as Orwell. Indeed, it is hard even for Orwell, as the second rule contains at least one, if not two, extraneous “outs,” thereby violating itself. Perhaps Orwell was suffering from something akin to a condition whose name he would never deign to use: Anosognosia. What, pray tell, is anosognosia? In a technical sense, it is a neurological disorder by which the sufferer of some disability is unaware of the existence or extent of that disability; it commonly follows strokes and other brain injuries. It might be said to be correlative to the “Dunning-Kruger effect,” the phenomenon whereby one suffering from inadequacy in a given arena is likely to suffer illusions of superiority in that very arena. These are all fancy terms whose deployment is like breaking a dam, releasing a torrent of “metacognition” and “receptive aphasia” and “proprioception” and all sorts of sesquipedalian terms (like, for example, sesquipedalian). But at base these all reduce to some form of the same thing—a lack of self-awareness. Everyone overestimates her own abilities and knowledge, both absolutely and relatively, constantly playing the fool and seldom realizing it. It is a cosmic joke told by, as H.L. Mencken might say, a comedian whose audience is afraid to laugh. A reference to Mencken is strangely appropriate in discussing Get Out, Jordan Peele’s terrific writing-directing debut. For one, Mencken, the bon vivant and influential critic and scholar of American life during the first half of the 20th century, showed no trace of self-doubt in his writing—a sure sign of some deficit of self-perception. More than that, though, Mencken—an often brilliant mind, wittily skewering those on all sides with clarity and incisiveness—was an avowed racist. “The educated Negro of today is a failure, not because he meets insuperable difficulties in life, but because he is a Negro,” wrote Mencken. Advancement might be possible, he conceded, but it would always and inevitably occur on a delay. Today’s polite society would not tolerate statements as bald-faced as Mencken’s, but the sentiments haven’t vanished so much as camouflaged themselves behind all manner of obfuscation and coded terminology, discussions of “work ethic” and “cultural differences” and the like. That movement is probably progress, however insufficient—things do not change overnight, but as long as the change is relatively constant and maintains some sense of forward momentum, it is something. But what is truly frightening—what Get Out makes central to its horror—is that no amount of progress can make people stop being people. No amount of legislative or electoral victory, no quota of social interaction, no scrim of politesse can cure the overarching disease of obliviousness endemic to the human condition. If the “Dunning-Kruger effect” is real—and anyone who has dealt with a precocious child or discussed her vocation with a layperson who once read the headline of an article about said vocation can tell you it is—then the less racist we think we are, the more freely our racism will flow by virtue of our failure to put up any obstacles to stop it. In the moment, Get Out is thrilling, frightening and funny in the manner of so many good horror films. But its implications, rattling around for weeks after the credits roll, are much less thrilling and much, much more frightening. On first glance, Get Out seems to work best in its opening half, before it has to begin explaining what is really happening and resolving the conflicts it has set in motion. This is unsurprising—it is true not just of many debut films, but also of many mystery or horror films, whose setups are almost always more compelling than their conclusions, which necessarily close doors that anticipation had left open. Peele’s script is sharp and perceptive, skewering a particular brand of seemingly well-intentioned but often clueless liberal racism. As Rose (Allison Williams) notes that her parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener), would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have, or as Dean notes with pride his ancestor’s “accomplishment” of losing to Jesse Owens at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) responds with bits of bemusement and self-control and irritation and exasperation. Kaluuya is brilliant, his eyes and face conveying multitudes while his surface strives to convey equanimity. He is a model of sangfroid, and Peele’s decision to cast the indignities he suffers against the background of meeting the parents—an already fraught situation no matter the participants—is a stroke of genius. But then the explanation must come. Peele has been open about his inspirations for Get Out, chief among them Rosemary’s Baby and The Stepford Wives, with the malevolent forces facing women in America replaced by those facing black people in America. Thus, although Get Out toys for quite some time with the possibility that nothing is really amiss—that Chris is just a person of particularly high situational intelligence surrounded by those of lesser capability—because we know we are watching a horror movie, we know this not to be so. Rosemary Woodhouse might have been paranoid, but she was not—the cultic neighbors and her husband really were using her body to bring the Antichrist to power. Joanna Eberhart might have been paranoid, but she was not—her new neighbors really were being replaced by robotic counterfeits full of the submission and soullessness their flesh-and-blood counterparts lacked. And Chris might be paranoid, but he is not—as his best friend, TSA agent Rod (LilRel Howery), is happy to remind him, there really is something awry in this exurban enclave. (**Spoilers yon.**) It is easy to pick apart a scheme’s explanation, especially the more convoluted it becomes—crafting a satisfactory answer is exceedingly difficult, which is why the lack of an answer is often the most satisfying outcome. It is why Peele’s choice not to over-explain the medical procedure that Dean’s father developed is such a wise one. We can accept that transplanting an older, ailing white person’s brain into a younger, healthy black person’s body, combined with some of Missy’s patented teacup hypnosis, results in a black body controlled by a white consciousness, with the former black consciousness relegated to the so-called “sunken place.” Any attempts to further elaborate would be counterproductive, making the inherently implausible seem less plausible by straining to convince of its plausibility. What is bedeviling upon initial consideration is that, in a movie about race, Get Out’s explanation seems to sidestep racial considerations. That the old or enfeebled would want renewed youth and vigor is a universally applicable concern—many attest to a preference for the knowledge and experience they have gained with age over the foolishness and ignorance of their youth, but few would argue that their deteriorating bodies work as well as they once did. And that one might use his resources to acquire eternal or returned youth is universally understandable. It is why the story of Ponce de León’s search for the Fountain of Youth continues to hold sway despite likely being a myth—it seems only too plausible that the royal and rich would expend time and money looking for immortality. And so Get Out’s revelation, while unsettling—being trapped as a cave dweller in your own body is horrifying indeed—at first seems somewhat lackluster. After such a pitch-perfect satire of post-racial race relations, to have a solution that renders race an afterthought is...peculiar. Yet the more Peele’s resolution reverberates, the more its brilliance becomes apparent. Chris asks, “Why black people?”, and the answer pretends that blackness has little to do with it. But the answer is given by those with sociological anosognosia—of course blackness has everything to do with it; otherwise the chosen ones would not be exclusively black. And of course that choice would reside in perceptions of a post-racial America that never existed, in blackness having “a moment” or being “cool,” in persistent stereotypes of athleticism and sexual prowess/endowment, in covetousness of others’ artistic impulses and abilities, and in the self-serving lie that one is accepting of all comers. That a rich white person should subject herself to the systemic indignities and difficulties facing a black person in America seems ludicrous—unless, of course, that rich white person has convinced herself that those difficulties have been mostly solved (no doubt in large part thanks to her efforts), or that she can solve them once she is operating from the inside, so to speak. Were race truly to have nothing to do with Get Out’s twists and turns, it would undoubtedly be a failing—but that its villains claim, or even truly believe, that to be the case undoubtedly is not. Which leaves only the matter of Get Out’s other big revelations: Whether Rose is an innocent pawn in her parents’ scheme or a willing participant; and whether that police car arriving at the final moment will be Chris’ salvation or his undoing. As uniformly excellent as Get Out’s cast is—Kaluuya in particular stands out, and is unlikely to receive the awards consideration he richly deserves—Williams occupies a trickier role than Keener, Whitford, and their friends and family. Dean and Missy need never come across as fully innocent—even before the full scale of their treachery is revealed, they can be impolitic and rude to the domestic staff and boorish so as to keep open the question of whether they are villainous or merely clueless. But Rose, before revealing herself to be the ice queen at the center of the Armitage family’s 21st century spin on the slave auction, must be convincingly sweet and progressive, virtuous and naïve. The decision to cast Williams in the role is astute—few actresses better embody the frustratingly amorphous notion of “whiteness,” especially a certain varietal of “whiteness,” as though a carton of soy milk and an episode of Parks and Recreation had mated and their offspring given square-but-not-too-square-jawed form. But Williams acquits herself admirably beyond her mere casting, making it a truly open question as to what, if anything, Rose knows about her family’s enterprise while also making her ultimate hostility as believable as possible. (The film’s descent into full-on carnage-soaked mayhem, while no doubt entertaining and not without its subversive thrills, is a bit disappointingly rote—one climactic shoot ‘em up/stab ‘em up/beat ‘em up can only be so different from the others. And everyone’s ultimate unvarnished evil—especially Rose’s—washes away a bit of the compelling and productive discomfort of the film’s earlier social satire, which had an audience-mirroring quality that the closing rampage lacks.) As for the fake-out of Rod’s last-second arrival, it makes for a fine joke, but also something more. The dyspepsia evoked by the flashing red and blue lights recalls the ending of Night of the Living Dead, and of Rosemary’s Baby and The Stepford Wives and countless other horror films—the final twist of the knife, the last-second reversal that erases whatever hope the audience might have clung to. The intractable melancholic in me enjoys such endings, and it would not have been entirely out-of-step with Get Out’s message to have a police officer exit the vehicle and fall for Rose’s ruse that the chaos on display is Chris’ doing. (Indeed, Peele has said that earlier drafts of the script had just such a gut-punch ending.) But the fact that it is Rod—the fact that Get Out ends on something of an upbeat note—is a testament to Peele’s ultimate positivity. Peele has said he wanted to leave the audience with an escape, with a positive feeling upon exiting the theater. And while it’s true that a sunny ending is an easier sell, which no doubt played a role in getting producers on board—Peele is no more immune to bouts of wobbly self-awareness than the rest of us—it gives a bit of hope. Perhaps our pervasive and inescapable tendency not to know our own weaknesses—our species-wide anosognosia—is not the fatal flaw it seems to be. Perhaps at the end of every dark and dreary road lies a shiny car with a wisecracking, day-saving Rod. God I hope so.",11,120,15,"1,139","4,959",13/4/17,rated-8

Though there are countless other movies about the issue, none explore it quite so uniquely as Peele. Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris, a black photographer who travels with his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to meet her parents. Rose hasn’t told her parents that Chris is black, causing him much concern over how they’ll react. When he does meet her family, they’re receptive and welcoming, but something still seems off. The fact that Chris is black is a topic that lingers uncomfortably in seemingly every conversation. Get Out builds in suspense as the walls close in on Chris, perpetually in paranoia as he begins to doubt the family’s seemingly good intentions. Horror is at its best when it is able to address personal and societal anxieties through its subject matter. Alien’s perverse imagery of rape, It Follows’ monster symbolic of the fears around adolescent sexuality, and The Babadook’s clear metaphor for grief are all exceptional examples of cinema exploiting our deepest dreads and fears through the genre of horror. Get Out is no different, but explores issues present in African American lives that Hollywood frequently neglects. Peele’s script brilliantly weaves in the racist microaggressions found in modern America with a sense of paranoia that many African Americans experience today. He takes what must be a common source of anxiety: a black man meeting his white girlfriend’s parents for the first time, and dials it up to 11. I first saw Get Out back in February with some friends and immediately had to see it again the next weekend. It’s a fantastic piece of cinema addressing the African American experience, and without a doubt a highlight of last year’s cinema.

I definitely did enjoy it though. I liked the little twists it had and how it follows a storyline based on race that is very subtle at the start but gradually gets more and more obvious and it goes. I liked the on-going comparison between a possible black man's life and a possible white family's life. It came across very personal to Jordan Peele with the little digs at the police officer and other white characters in the film. It's shot beautifully and the score is different from other horrors that I've seen. The writing was ok. I found myself watching scenes that had a load of exposition and it got kind of annoying. The hypnosis was a cool idea and it was fairly unique to me.

Jordan Peele's directorial debut is one that must be seen by everyone because this is definitely one of the better horror films in recent memory along with a couple of others. I dug the innovative concept this film brought out as it's never really been done before by anyone else, but Peele really puts it to fantastic use here and throughout the film as it gets even more tense.  Everybody puts out their clever performances especially from the talented actors who adequately portrayed the Armitage family and Daniel Kaluuya's principal character as well as he has goes through hell and back with them to fight for his survival.  It's a modern day horror masterpiece for sure, and I can't wait to see what Jordan Peele does next with the upcoming Candyman reboot.

Elegant, pulpy, and smart, the film blends tension with a touch of humor and racial commentary with throwback chills for a genre film that is terrifically effective. ""Get Out"" follows a romantically involved young woman and man on a visit to meet the young woman's parents. At first, the parents seem normal, but secrets are soon revealed that cause the young man to fear that things may not be what they seem.  Those secrets will not be revealed here, but they power a narrative that is twisted and smart. There are classic genre underpinnings, like the family with a secret and the mad scientist, that collide compellingly with direct statements on race and America's slave-holding past. Delivered by a screenplay that is rife with foreshadowing and wit, the film's story and themes are rich. Peele builds something that moves in slow and steady rhythms. The occasional jolt punctuates scenes that exude a sturdy dread, but the director skillfully heats up slow-boiling tension that results in nightmarish moments. The climax may be violent and unhinged, but, to get there, Peele makes his audience move through a hushed maze of questions and suggestion. Danger is palpable, but it is quiet. The film's aesthetic is clear-eyed, but there is a visual sensibility that harkens back to domestic horror films of decades past. A cold atmosphere juxtaposes the warm colors of an affluent home. Editing increases tension, and Peele's cast communicates the film's fear, betrayal, and well-placed humor with textured grace. ""Get Out"" is a masterful genre outing from an unexpected voice. It is deep, heady, and fun, and it neatly layers disparate tones to invigorating effect. 2017 may not see a better or more impactful horror film.",6,69,7,500,"4,566",3-Mar-17,rated-9

Loved the first half, which plays like a less overtly funny version of a first-rate Key & Peele sketch, extended for maximum discomfort; Kaluuya, who was so quietly impressive in Sicario, turns in one of the most expressively reactive performances I can recall, projecting Chris' true emotions—half-pained, half-amused at self-serving proclamations of allyship; dumbfounded by casual overt racism—through a credible scrim of politeness. (Casting a dramatic actor, rather than Key or himself, was an inspired choice on Peele's part. Kaluuya is already my choice to beat for lead male this year.) The big twist, however, kinda defangs the movie. ""Why us? Why black people?"" Chris asks, and the answer feels ad hoc, because race isn't really intrinsic to the (fairly decent, if familiar) horror-movie idea Peele came up with. Elderly or disabled people wanting to inhabit younger, healthier bodies makes perfect sense in any context; there are potentially pointed and discomfiting reasons to demand African-American vessels, but Get Out, surprisingly (given how consistently sharp the setup is), doesn't dig in. I suspect that's because Peele recognized that it's much creepier for the groundskeeper and the maid to be Stepford-y rather than, say, clumsily ""black"" (i.e. appropriation as possession, which seems like the obvious thematic choice if you're shrewdly taking aim at ""the good ones"" rather than deplorables). The satire and the horror mesh so weakly that strengthening one inevitably means diminishing the other. And revealing the ostensibly well-meaning white liberals as pure evil, rather than deluded, lets them (me) off the hook. Still very much worth seeing for Kaluuya's magnificently dry reaction shots throughout the first half, as Chris arduously scales Wokeback Mountain.",2,308,25,54,"16,710",24-Feb-17,rated-6

What it lacks in fear, it nearly makes up for in fearlessness. When Hollywood wants to talk about race, it’s usually an inspirational film, set at some point in the past, that sparks discussion. It doesn’t matter if that setting is the 19th century, the civil rights movement, or even sometime last week; it’s any time that isn’t right this moment. Stories of injustice are always more comfortable being watched over your shoulder, so these films bring a wedge of distance so that (white) audiences don’t feel implicated in the on-screen suffering. “Get Out,” however, feels no such obligations. A broadly commercial horror comedy about a black guy trying to survive his first weekend with his white girlfriend’s family, it’s locked in the present, it’s about race, and — more than that — it’s about how it can’t not be about race.

Because it was intense and suspense. The movie might seem like a thriller/horror film at first. But it is more than that. It is a political satire of racism. So while it feels thrilling and unsettling, it makes you think about liberal racism for the entire movie. It also makes you question whether most people are as genuine and humane as they seem. There is one more thing though. It is how dangerous hypnosis can be. Even the thought of having your mind controlled by someone else and trying to avoid being brainwashed is quite frightening. A lot of thought were put into the script. It sets a great example of genius brand storytelling. Well, the fear of not being able to get out of a house in which you are imprisoned as a potential transhuman experimentation subject is quite scary. However, the fear of living in a society that might think like those experimenters, who lack of humanity, is much scarier. Therefore, this movie conveys a social message to the audience, to the world. It is not a regular thriller film. It is a social thriller.  ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer"" actually happens in ""Get Out"". Deer is not only a metaphor but it is also an animal, a victim, a bust wall sculpture and a weapon. Deer is everything. Pay close attention to deer in every single scene. Because it is absolutely sacred in this movie. I think, it is safe to say when there is a deer featured in a movie, it would be smart to expect lots of creepiness. The directing is excellent. The face-offs and the close-ups are meant to create anxiety in the audience. The acting is so good. The actors are great at conveying emotions via facial expressions, verbal language and body language. They all are in character and they all are in complete sync with each other and the director during the entire film. ""Get Out"" definitely lives up to the hype and totally deserves it. It is not just Chris Washington who has to get out. All of us have to get out of any place that screams racism, fetishism and objectification, and transhumanism.",5,85,8,647,"1,173",16-Jan-18,rated-9

Produced on a low budget with a relatively unheralded cast, its original spin on a multitude of horror staples as well as a couple of brand new ideas of its own lead to critical acclaim and healthy box office returns. But it has an effect beyond that. All of a sudden you have a whole bunch of people in the mainstream film media, mostly, piping up with statements such as, ""It's the shot in the arm the tired horror genre needed!"" If you believed what they had to say, then apparently the horror genre has been completely worthless for about 30-odd years save for the odd indie breakout offering like this. The last one of this type was It Follows, of course. It really annoys me that there's still so much ignorance towards horror and the quality that is produced in the genre, mostly under the radar, on a regular basis. Most of it goes completely unheralded, some of it fades completely from view, and because most critics still view it as a lesser genre they never bother to dig deeper and find the fine films that are made in the genre all the time. So I'm not buying this claptrap that's been wheeled out by so many voices in the mainstream press about Get Out being a wake-up call for horror in terms of injecting it with quality that it allegedly needed. Just open your fucking eyes and look beyond the multiplexes. But by all means praise Get Out for where it is actually important - the ethnicities of its writer-director and its lead star. It's important enough that Jordan Peele and Daniel Kaluuya (who should already have turned everyone's heads with his extremely under-appreciated turn in Sicario anyway) head up a movie which is raking in accolades and ridiculous box office returns, but it's what Peele brings to the horror table thematically that interests me most of all. His satirical stab at 'some of my best friends are black!' white people desperately over-compensating for not wanting to be seen as racist (even though they are) is marvellously weaved into a horror plot that they themselves seem to be presenting as a compliment to the men they have captured. What a bloody treat Peele serves up as a result because, hey! He actually knows what he's talking about. He's not some white dude with good intentions doing his best with a plate of assumptions.  It's powerful, meaningful and recognisable. As much as I laughed at so much of Get Out, I also did so from a position of, ""Yeah. We are exactly fucking like that, aren't we?"" Taking things like a game of bingo and even having a cup of tea and turning them into something genuinely sinister is remarkable on two levels, but I don't think Peele is necessarily even taking shots from a position of anger. The attitude of Kaluuya to his hosts echoes a lot of what I read from the direction here. To a certain extent Get Out is cursed by its own high quality. It's far from being the only horror film made that spins such a devious and wrongfooting tale and almost backs itself into a corner of leaving an audience demanding similar such brilliance from its climax. Peele doesn't quite stick the ending here - it's not so much the violent escape and revenge that Kaluuya effects against his hosts, but that a couple of questions remain. What will now happen to the rest of the people in this 'family', especially the black people who have been kidnapped? Everything else, however, is a joy. Peele pulls off one of the most difficult things in film direction, in my opinion, and that is finding an almost perfect balance in his horror-comedy preference - even more remarkable considering this is his debut. It's also filled with imagery and oddities that will undoubtedly reward repeat viewings and voracious rewatching. As much as I love a nice surprise when I watch a film for the first time, it can be equally as pleasurable to visit a film with a lofty reputation, whether built over a number of years or fostered by a current sky-high level of hype, and find it to be completely justifying all the attention it's getting. Also, congratulations to Blumhouse on another successful production - they're in danger of looking reasonably competent after this and Split. Get Out would definitely put the 'oo' in Typhoo.",12,80,9,469,"10,150",21-Mar-17,rated-9

The only way to really begin a dialogue regarding Jordan Peele's Get Out - a surrealistic and searing Buñuel horror show - is to observe its final image and ponder the implications. Composed of flashing police lights dissipating into a tunnel of darkness while a woman is bleeding fast towards the finality of death, its basic informational grammar, taken without context, visualizes defiant (or oblivious) law enforcement in the face of a serious, life-or-death situation. If you were to take this image and present it to various individuals, the reaction would be a uniform one: ""why is the police car driving away from an active crime scene? Isn't someone in need of assistance?""  Taken with context, with all necessary background knowledge witnessed, the real question is: ""why didn't Chris kill Rose?""  It's a scene laced with thorns. When the police car first arrives, what did I think? ""Oh, how is he going to explain this to the police officer?!"" I figured Peele was yanking the fantasy right out of our guts, forcing an audience to realize violence's inherent grimness even when surrounded by devious racists and a sinister aura of appropriation, but the truth was like being prodded by a cow iron. Seeing Rod - played to perfection by LilRel Howery - step out of the driver's seat was equal in sight to an angel in the nighttime; a scene so unearthly that previous visions of a hypnotic limbo feel gravitated to reality. My mostly white audience breathed a collective sigh of relief, but the switcheroo on Peele's part is of greater agency than a thrill (although it undoubtedly succeeds). It provides an empathetic meeting place where common ground can be felt across a silver screen and a packed genre crowd; in this moment, Get Out teaches.  And it doesn't only teach about the idea of what we perceive and how such a notion may be constructed due to staggering systemic racial divisions in 2017's America, but that the thought is *shared*. We continue to live in a society where the combination of a police car and a black citizen inherently alludes to confrontation, violence, arrest, oppression, and yet, the real, and sad, truth is found in how Peele can grasp a situational example of ethnic tension and multipurpose it into a thrill which anyone can comprehend. Starting with this moment, a culmination of dubious cogency, feels like the only logical way to write about such a waking nightmare of a film - feverish, witty, sharp as a deer's antlers - because it both begins and ends with us, the public, the American people.  It begins with us as detached; constructing a premise where the 'white liberal' racist tendencies and lingering, stuffy quirks are subtle in their conversational awareness. You've probably heard age-old generational stories showcasing long-term familial connection with other ethnicities or persisting political issues which only seem to be mentioned for a nod by the receiving party. Maybe you've even been on the suffering end, maybe you've even said such things, but the specificity ends there. Get Out is here to probe these memories - whether personal or collective or cultural - out of you and say: look, it's all around you, and it's in Everywhere, USA, no less.  But it ends with us having experienced something divided in a divided time yet the audience has been sharing an examination of the Black Experience. Everyone, in every theater in every city and town, is on the same page, witnessing commodification based around racial Myth and devious, harrowing ignorance found under the living rooms of the rich only to fester in the hearts of communities. Get Out is not a film which ends with America metaphorically holding hands, but it is representative of the divide which still casts a shadow across this land and how whiteness continues to own the prospects and attributes of the black body. Rose being left for dead by Chris, deciding not to kill her - an ingenious, unspoken visual image of black command - isn't the only aspect that sets a volatile message aflame. It's that Chris did nothing wrong.  All for now. Probably more after a rewatch. Formally, structurally, conceptually; a masterpiece of American horror.",9,729,25,512,"30,140",25-Feb-17,rated-10

On the other hand I am quite tickled it has been so well received for it gives me hope in my fellow man.. and that's something I haven't had for a long long time!  Don't see the movie because of 4 and 5 star ratings!  See it because it is a film that is the perfect allegory for the current and political times we find ourselves living in. See it because it gives us an opportunity to open up and have a real honest to goodness dialogue across America! See the film for the masterful direction coming from a newbie director whom presents a film with the mad skills of a seasoned veteran! A story well told, well acted and worthy of your time.

What it lacks in fear, it nearly makes up for in fearlessness. When Hollywood wants to talk about race, it’s usually an inspirational film, set at some point in the past, that sparks discussion. It doesn’t matter if that setting is the 19th century, the civil rights movement, or even sometime last week; it’s any time that isn’t right this moment. Stories of injustice are always more comfortable being watched over your shoulder, so these films bring a wedge of distance so that (white) audiences don’t feel implicated in the on-screen suffering. “Get Out,” however, feels no such obligations. A broadly commercial horror comedy about a black guy trying to survive his first weekend with his white girlfriend’s family, it’s locked in the present, it’s about race, and — more than that — it’s about how it can’t not be about race.

In terms of telling a horror story, on paper it's nothing too new, but Peele is able to build upon the off-kilter clues that something is seriously wrong until the ending barrels like a freight train to the finish, keep the dialogue interesting and get the most from his actors, and add some interesting everyday social commentary to make it interesting. This movie really owes it to the actors, especially Daniel Kaluuya who always look on edge and constantly thinking behind his awkward smile, this is a film where every part is played perfectly and I can't imagine a single line delivered in any other way by anyone else. The movie plays up the social awkwardness between people of different backgrounds who don't see eye to eye for both comedic effect and for creating tense scenes. Nothing beats those awkward encounters as Chris tries to find ""brothers"" he can relate to better and have his expectations dashed by their strange mannerisms. Things always feel off thanks to the dialogue & the delivery, the framing of shots, and the effective score, which only build to the frighteningly surreal Sunken Place and the eventual reveal of the master plan. I really wish I went into this film without any idea of where it would go, but it is fun to fit together the pieces and the film must be incredibly rewatchable. Peele plays with imagery and themes of slavery (and LilRel Howery's hilarious rants about sex slaves) to lure the audience towards one place, only to go to another that is even more terrifying: the ability to wipe away one's identity completely and how devastating it would be if the Coagula treatment was utilized by much more discriminatory groups to homogenize a culture. It's a film that reinforces how important identity is to individuals and to cultures, and how actions that may not be racially motivated can devastate identity. All coming from a movie with a bonkers brainwashing premise. And holy shit that ending is tight. Peele is not afraid to make Chris Washington into a no-nonsense badass who will fight his way against the villains. That final confrontation between Rose and Chris is so layered and devastating with a smile that says a thousand words reinforced by centuries of racial violence and a subversion of a culturally significant trope that luckily leads to a crowd-pleasing ending (Seriously, William is the man. One of the best comic relief characters I've seen in a while.). ""Get Out"" is a phenomenal, deceptively simple and effective horror movie that plays with every element to offer a biting social wake-up call. Trim down a few of William's scenes after he can't get in touch with Chris and take out that stupid-ass exposition VHS, and it's a perfect movie.",3,112,1,"9,849","2,990",29-Oct-19,rated-10

This may seem as a harsh criticism for film so universally praised, but for me Peele's ambitious film suffers from an identity crisis that muddles the effect of what it set out to do. When the first act was drawing to a close I was really into Get Out. It felt like a superbly handled satire on race relations set against a bizarre and sometimes unnerving backdrop. I felt Peele had a clear vision of how he wanted to bend the very topical theme of strained connections between races in his country and snugly fit it into the horror genre. And for a while he really managed just that. But once the plot starts to kick in he lost me as Get Out seemed to loosen its grip on its own identity and thus becoming neither fish nor fowl. It takes a lot of courage (unfortunately) to actually tackle the subject Peele wants to tackle, but attack it he does, it's just that he doesn't seem to be sure what his weapon of choice is supposed to be.  From the second act onward he foregoes satire for horror for straightforward comedy for thriller for gore etc. He hops and skips from one idea to the next, never really exploring their potential. The bizarre effect this had on me was that I went from admiration for something really clever or well executed (for example the creepy hypnosis scenes)  to raised eyebrows when we are treated to a poorly executed stereotype character (for example, the hero's best friend). This unbalance stole away any potential menace or any concern I felt for the protagonist.  Apart from the uneven tone, the plot is a bit too pedestrian to support its anything but pedestrian intentions. Even though it never really surprised and it is not that difficult to connect all the dots, Peele certainly shows a creative flair on many an occasion, finding cohesion is, unfortunately, not part of his arsenal yet. Really good separate parts do not always make a great whole. I really appreciate what Get Out set out to accomplish and I'm glad it has clicked with so many people. I wish it had had the same effect on me.",7,210,9,114,"18,826",17-Apr-17,rated-6

Much like The Matrix, it is obviously allegorical. But it can actually support a multitude of allegorical readings, which will make it a movie of enduring appeal.  Is it about the so-called ""Obama Effect,"" wherein the two-time election of a black president supposedly revealed a new, ""post-racial"" America? (Clearly white people have always had the prerogative to be post-racial, and now we have the ability to co-opt African-American culture as well.) Is it about the prison-industrial complex, the fact that America runs on black labor power that is controlled and directed by whites? (The Armitages have certainly found a new way to extract bio-power from African-Americans while simultaneously making their bodies disappear.) It could be largely about what it seems to be about, right on its surface -- the vicious racism lurking beneath white liberalism, the fetishization of the black body as the flipside to conservative fear of same. (In this regard, it speaks metaphorically to the way the Democratic Party makes demands of African-American voters, mobilizing them this way and that, while expecting them to capitulate to a rich, white power structure.) It could also be a paranoid fantasy regarding interracial relationships, which have become so normalized by millennials as to be virtually invisible. (If the threat of love is the basic unknowability of the other, than the acknowledgment of a cross-cultural divide can just as easily occlude understanding as initiate it.) What is certain is that Jordan Peele's crisp, visually adept direction marks the arrival of a major new talent. (Not ""new,"" of course, but scoring handily in a second area of endeavor. He should be able to write his own ticket now. Unless, you know, racism.) Clearly the work of a cinephile and horror aficionado, Get Out bears traces of classics too numerous to mention, although Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Stepford Wives are clear touchstones, along with John Frankenheimer's masterpiece Seconds.  But the insight into contemporary race relations is all Peele, and I hope that audiences will take it seriously as more than just a clever premise. The opening sequence, in which Andre (LaKeith Stanfield) is lost in a white suburb, should speak to anyone who remembers the name Trayvon Martin. That is, the very things that make white Americans feel safe are justifiably terrifying to most African-Americans.  This is reiterated in the final scene, when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is trying to kill Rose (Allison Williams) in self-defense, and we suddenly see the flashing red and blue lights of the police cruiser. Peele is playing with our fears and prejudices here, but for a moment, it looked like we were witnessing an arrival of the white cavalry, a horrific callback to the Klan on horseback in Birth of a Nation. Alas, Peele uses the power of imagination to give us the horror-genre payoff that has been delayed for as long as the movies have existed: the final black man.",6,90,5,145,"4,524",21-Apr-17,rated-7

Get Out tells the story of Chris Washington, a black photographer who takes a trip with his white girlfriend to meet her parents, and spend the weekend at their secluded estate. Everyone in the family tries to make him feel welcome at first but as weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a nightmarish revelation. Written & directed by Jordan Peele, Get Out is a stellar start to his filmmaking career and presents him in total control of his craft. Every moment plays a role in the final outcome, every little detail is vital to the plot, and every twist adds to the mystery. Also, Peele's ability to keep things amusing & infused with biting critique of modern society speaks volumes about his talents as a storyteller. Its low budget is efficiently handled and all the technical aspects work in harmony to heighten the film's foreboding atmosphere & mysterious aura, whether it's the plantation-like setting or the fluid but immaculate use of the camera or the steady pace or tight editing or its mystifying score. From its calm opening to its violent finale, it effortlessly manages to keep everyone on the edge of their seats. Coming to the performances, Daniel Kaluuya chips in with a deftly measured input in the role of Chris but Allison Williams isn't far behind as his girlfriend, Rose, and their input only gets stronger as the plot moves forward. Bradley Whitford & Catherine Keener play Rose's parents and there's an enigmatic quality in their work. Lil Rel Howery is mostly used as a comic relief, and the rest of the supporting cast is just as good, if not better. On an overall scale, Get Out is an exquisite blend of horror & dark comedy that interweaves its ingeniously layered narrative with timely social commentary to deliver a thrilling experience that's accomplished on all scales. Fresh, funny & frightening in equal doses, packed with savvy ideas & bold decisions, and pushing the boundaries of its genre(s) in its own bizarre fashion, Jordan Peele's debut feature is a smart, subversive & sardonic delight that's neither overt nor covert. One of the best all-round films of the year. Full review at: wp.me/p3KleJ-6ya",7,104,2,662,"8,792",1-Oct-17,rated-9

Bing search: NCAA Prospects ""I would have voted for Obama for a third term"" A very logical and organic progression of the themes Peele has been working with since MADTV and Key on Key and Peele: the constructed blurry lines around what constitutes blackness and its intersection (either violent or comedic, or both) with whiteness. Get Out is an assured confidant debut which manages to sustain a tense atmosphere even in scenes of not-horror, let's put it. Where Peele stumbles slightly is in the scenes of jump-scares, some of which are extremely effective (the gardener running) and some of which are disappointing and annoying (the piano chord when the housekeeper walks behind the protagonist). The central metaphor, like all good horror, is fecund and productive, and Peele doesn't entirely push the audience. It's not subtle, though it isn't as didactic as other, worse horror films do.",10,68,2,369,"1,943",25-Feb-17,rated-8

The line between the two is tricky to maintain here and it never really finds a strong balance.  Every time we start building tension or dread or mystery or unease with the racial undertones and general weird vibe Peele masterfully concocts, the film pinwheels and fumbles to push us through to the straight horror elements, to shove the narrative forward, to cut back to the bumbling sidekick character. It has a rocky opening, a great second act up until a point, and a back and forth walk between brilliant and just okay all the way to the end. The three standouts of the film were the party, the twist (that is so perfectly calibrated for this film.  It's as funny as it is fucked up and toes the line to pull us over into the final stretch), and THAT final moment (the blood-chillingly real one that I wish they had done more with because it was the harshest critique the movie had to offer and instead it let the audience off with a warning). It's a great debut from Peele and I'm very excited to see where he goes next, hopefully growing some more within this weird space he created.",4,73,7,69,704,23-Feb-17,rated-8

The Towering Inferno,1974,165,thriller,drama,action, ,8007,19 fans,3.32,16,68,94,526,762,2293,1901,1696,357,294," One of Hollywood’s most expensive disaster epics that took the finances of two studios and the amalgamation of two novels to get made The Towering Inferno is a very well made and big scale blockbuster. The story of The Towering Inferno is fairly standard Disaster movie stuff. Lots of people attend the opening of a brand new building that is at the height of technology and this goes badly wrong with the building catching fire and a small band of survivors having to find a way to escape whilst a heroic fireman and the architect of the building work together to save everyone. In truth The Towering Inferno offers absolutely nothing of note that’s in any way original or fresh and it does trot out all the old cliches that were already done in features such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure. I think this is to be expected but it’s also a little disappointing at how formulaic it is as a feature. For a project with so much money behind it of course if would’ve been nice to see a fresher end product.  However the shortcomings of the plot it must be said are marvellously glossed over by the stunning production values and wonderful, stirring direction of John Guillermin who does a fantastic job of controlling the hectic action here. The special effects it must be said for the time are an extraordinary achievement and the fire is a frightening and relentless foe that genuinely thanks to the brilliant production values feels like a real, genuine threat throughout. Guillermin does amazing work here as well in building the suspense during this picture. The tension creeps up and up throughout the film as we try to guess as an audience which member of the all star cast is going to be burnt to a cinder next and the manner in which the threat escalates overtime and gradually overpowers the fire crew is incredible and a big success for Guillermin and his crew. The rescue attempts are also brilliantly orchestrated and all the action sequences are directed with genuine ferocity and energy that is impressive. The Towering Inferno has a terrifically cinematic quality to it thanks to the outstanding use of sound and great visual work which makes it all the more exciting. From a casting perspective there is a crazy array of talent featured here. As the heroic fire chief at the heart of the rescue Steve McQueen is at his most serious but also his most likeable as his character tries to take control of the dire situation he faces here. Paul Newman also does some excellent work here as the building’s architect giving a measured, subdued supporting performance. Some of the stars it would’ve been nice to see more of but players such as Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, William Holden and Faye Dunaway are typically reliable and their star quality really helps the film to be as entertaining as it is. Fred Astaire is also very good here coping very well it must be said in a role he wasn’t particularly used to playing. In conclusion, although The Towering Inferno offers nothing really new to cinema and treads the same ground other disaster epics did beforehand it nonetheless is a thrilling, tense, often nail-biting drama that thanks to brilliant, daring set pieces and the assured work of an experienced star-studded cast goes a long way to achieving its aim of being a memorable highlight of its genre.",5,41,0,"8,058","3,108",6-Jul-19,rated-7

As The Towering Inferno approaches 40, it's safe to say that, bar some hammy acting, it has aged really well. It is classy filmmaking that still carries the same tension and horror it did the first time I saw it. While it doesn't give me the nightmares it gave me the first time I saw it, I still find the randomness and the fierceness of the fire terrifying. The cast is absolutely stellar and a joy to watch.

But then came 1972 and The Poseidon Adventure, the movie that put the desire in people to watch everything go wrong in the worst and biggest possible way, which paved the way for the sub-genre to this day. The Towering Inferno has it all: the big stars, epic length and scale and, most importantly, the flash. I imagine how excited audiences must've felt back in 1974 entering a movie theatre to watch Paul Newman and Steve McQueen fight 100-something floors' worth of hellfire. 39 years after, it was my turn to finally boot up this classic and see why it's such a big part of 70s pop culture. Although I was far from amazed, I must admit there were some nifty sequences in the flick. Oddily enough, none of them include the interactions between the 3 big names in the cast (Paul Newman, Steve McQueen and William Holden). That honor is reserved for the wide shots of the skyscraper before and after its on fire, especially on the scenic elevator sequence. Even by today's standards, those were very impressive. The rest of nearly-3 hour experience is much more lackluster, with bland scene after another intercut with a much needed action fix. After a while you may find yourself hoping that the fire starts chewing a little bit faster through the iron. The script also fails to take advantage of such a star-studded cast. Small supporting characters aside, you could summarize all of this movie's main characters with a couple of words and nothing would be lost. There was a famous going around the production involving MCQueen's and Newman's egos and the number of lines each had on the script, so I'm guessing that had something to do with it. Structure wise I think it's fine, as it allocated enough time to develop the characters and story. They only forgot to put enough development to fill in the gaps. I don't think I'll ever miss The Towering Inferno, but there are worse ways to spend a Saturday. Trapped in a burning building with OJ Simpson, for example.",5,10,0,286,556,3-Aug-13,rated-5

I went through a phase where I was fascinated by skyscrapers, but the very idea behind this movie gave them a touch of dread. How awful would it be to be stuck above the flames, too high for rescue? (needless to say, this feeling came back with a great, queasy power in 2001.) This movie takes place in a fictional San Francisco skyscraper so tall - about the size of NYC's new One World Trade Center - that they had to invent another fictional supertall skyscraper just to make one of the rescue scenes work. (in fact, San Francisco's had the same tallest building in town for over forty years.) The effects are generally great, and the huge cast is your expected spread of overqualified Hollywood veterans playing one-dimensional roles, but getting their faces in a square at the bottom of the poster. (by today's standards, two women and maybe, MAYBE Richard Chamberlain would have a shot at being cast.) There's one scene of legit terror, when professional tuxedo rack Robert Wagner and his girlfriend are menaced by the flames and have no real way out. (meanwhile, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen's behind-the-scenes ego-clash is some legendary pettiness shit. Who could read about this and not lose some respect for both of them?) But it is almost three hours long, and the non-disaster parts of the story can't really carry it. The disaster film has been a malleable, durable genre - you see it hammered into movies that are otherwise sci-fi, horror, adventure, even romance - but in its purest form, it tends to be bloated and a little tedious like this. Titanic gets a bad rap for its sentimentality and James Cameron's turn away from R ratings and sci-fi, but for a three-hour beast, goddammit she moved. This is that purest form. It is done better here than anything else in that pure form I can think of. It could've used some swashbuckling. Or an alien death ray.",5,4,0,129,469,24-Jun-15,rated-6

I don't think it deserved the best picture nomination it received, but nonetheless it's still enjoyable. You gotta pay attention when you're watching though, because after a while people start dying left and right with little mention of them once they're gone.  One funny moment: the cause of the fire looked to be straight out of an elementary school fire safety video.

He quickly discovers that the firm has cut corners on a few things, including the safety features and the electrical systems. Wouldn't you know it, there's a reason those things are important and, before you know it, a fire is raging in this building, threatening the lives of everyone inside...including the who's who of San Francisco society and a senator (Robert Vaughn) who have gathered for this building's gala opening.  I can't remember if I'd ever seen all of this movie before or just bits and pieces. I certainly didn't remember all that much of it. I mean, clearly, I knew there was a fire involved. But a lot of it seemed brand new to me on this watch.  But, then again, there's not a lot of memorable stuff going on. People are trapped in places, stairs are taken down during random explosions, Paul Newman gets up in people's faces about not building to his specifications, and the moment they introduce that ""scenic elevator"" you know some shit is going down with it, but I was expecting more somehow. We get to see some people start on fire, which isn't boring, but the pace definitely feels sluggish here compared to ""The Poseidon Adventure"", for instance.  The characters are fine, though there's not a lot to them. Paul Newman is solid as always (the expression on his face as he approaches the building in a helicopter is pretty rad, for reasons I can't explain...maybe it's just fun to see Paul that damned happy). Steve McQueen is excellent here, less prone to histrionics than most of the cast and just believably portraying a professional doing a hard job to the best of his ability (he's casually cool somehow, as he is in most movies...I'm starting to realize that every performance this guy gave felt natural and effortless, he managed to be the most subtle coolest man on Earth ever). Faye Dunaway is good. William Holden is good. (Hey, a ""Network"" pre-union!) This is a ridiculously stacked cast, and all of them are quite good (Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones are worth noting too) but none of them really popped off the screen like Hackman in ""Poseidon"", for instance.  The movie never quite justified its epic length, in my opinion. I found it slow most of the time, and underwhelming. Also, the fire seems inconsistent. It kind of jumps floors and no one really comments on it. It seemed that there were some continuity issues in the editing, maybe. I definitely felt the editing could have been employed in tightening this whole affair up, at least. Maybe ""The Towering Inferno"" was trying to be too classy for its own good. It's a cheesy disaster flick that's trying to be a prestige picture. This honestly works more often than it doesn't, but it tends to drag. That's not fatal, though, there's still enough going on that I wasn't entirely bored, at least not for very long. The movie particularly comes alive whenever McQueen is onscreen (I need to go through a McQueen run here soon) and Newman is always fun to watch. But then you've got guys like Robert Wagner and Richard Chamberlain whose efforts make this film feel like a glorified TV movie at times. Robert Vaughn falls into this camp too, even though I enjoy his work (as always). And then there's the presence of O.J. Simpson, not the greatest of actors even before he became a problematic presence...though he does save a kitty cat, which was downright sweet. ""The Towering Inferno"" is fine but it doesn't have the novel premise of something like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or the cheesy devotion to spectacle that a lot of other disaster movies had. At the end of the day, it's just a fake-looking building on fire. Some of the situations are properly intense, some of the acting is solid, and there are exciting moments. It just feels like there's a lot of filler padding everything out, and some of it feels downright cheap (though I'm sure it wasn't). Had they shaved about half an hour out of this thing and cut some of the less interesting sub-plots (maybe the one involving Robert Wagner), this movie would have been legitimately great. As is, it definitely has its moments, enough of them for me to lightly recommend this, but it doesn't feel quite as tight or tense as ""The Poseidon Adventure"". My wife, on the other hand, preferred this one to ""Poseidon Adventure"", so maybe I was just groggy. It's entirely possible I could love this movie at some point in the future. After all, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman are in it.",8,9,0,"1,411","1,140",23-Jun-19,rated-6

As election results continue to slowly roll in, I turn not to another political satire like The Candidate but rather to my favorite 70s disaster film, the ultimate icon of its genre, The Towering Inferno. 2 hours and 45 minutes of pure adrenaline, probably more effective horror than anything I watched in October. I've seen it so many times that I can practically quote the screenplay in my sleep, so in a way it's no longer a stressful experience; I actually felt less election anxiety while watching just because my mind was distracted so well. My favorite pieces of IMDb trivia (other than Roderick Thorp using the film as inspiration for his novel Nothing Lasts Forever, which later became the film Die Hard): ""[Natalie] Wood declined because she was pregnant with her second child; she also found the script 'mediocre'"" and ""John Frankenheimer refused to direct this film.""

And Fire, this film, The Towering Inferno (1974), about a newly opened building being set ablaze due to wiring malfunctions.  Each of these films had many things in common. Large star-studded casts, high production value, raking in tons of money at the box office, even garnering critical acclaim (This and Airport were nominated for Best Picture), and they're all extremely cheesy. I know I've only seen this and Airport, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the other two are quite similar.  Now, I'll give credit where credit is due. Unlike Airport, this one is actually interesting. It has actual characters that you can occasionally care for. It's even quite exciting and/or tragic in some scenes, such as the deaths of a certain couple on the 65th floor.  But, this film falls into the trap that a lot of similar big budget disaster movies fall into: they have a shit script. I know, it's hard to write characters good, but you've got to try. I did say that there are some good characters, but there's also a lot of uninteresting ones. These films treat characters like a Mel Brooks movie treats jokes: Just throw as many at the wall as you can and hope some of them stick. But, unlike Mel Brooks, these writers aren't talented, so a lot of characters fall flat.  The best characters are, what a shocker, the ones that get the most screentime, that being those of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen (there is a very interesting story about these two fighting over top billing for the film that I'll let you look up for yourself). Other notable people (meaning famous actors) are William Holden playing the ""guy in charge who doesn't want anything done until it's too late"" cliche, Faye Dunaway being completely wasted, and then there's Fred Astaire, who won a Golden Globe and a BAFTA for this performance and nearly stole the Oscar from Robert DeNiro in The Godfather Part II but luckily that did not happen because he does not deserve any accolades for this performance. There's also O.J. Simpson as a security guard.....I'll let you write your own jokes for that. They're probably better than anything I could come up with.  Overall, the film is half melodramatic snoozefest and half gripping disaster film, leaving you with a pretty average film. I'd say check this one out, if it either sounds interesting or you just want to be informed on part of film history, this being the most successful of the 70s disaster films. Otherwise, just watch Die Hard.",10,6,0,398,969,1-Jun-18,rated-6

I was impressed with this movie. Technically really beautiful. There was no cgi in '74. Working around that much fire and explosion must have taken an army to supervise. The multi-storylines running through this thing was ambitious, and really it was the only reason why the 3+ hr run time feels justified. Aesthetically I was all in. Every floor (they showed) of this skyscraper was extremely '74 and extremely my jawn. Carpet and extravagance abound. Overall, obvious parallels with Jurassic Park come to mind (even counting the John Williams!). Fault lie in the human counterpart the achievement of building The Glass Tower. Cutting corners out of laziness and greed, never assuming the worst could happen. Until it does and then systems fail everywhere. I wonder if Crichton was influenced by this (and others like it)?  I imagine a 40-50 year old in 1974 having grown up watching the people in this movie. All this star power in one movie, after watching them in shit you loved for have your life.

At first, I wondered why he was even in this, co-starring with 70s icons of cool Paul Newman and Steve McQueen, but then I realized just how much of a contrast him being in a disaster movie is created. The previous generation's icon of glamour and class is suddenly thrust into a situation where both glamour and class slowly collapse, no one is safe from the inferno. None of the themes are really too well developed, as there's simply so much going on, but there's also something about being against the creation of these massive skyscrapers, traditionally a symbol of progress and human ingenuity, which could have been delved into some more, as it's really only explored in one or two lines from Steve McQueen. More prominent is the theme of corporate greed, and possibly nepotism, being the true cause of this disaster. So, nothing too original on that front, but at least there's something. Paul Newman is the architect, and Steve McQueen is the fire chief. Together, they combine their coolness to put out this fire while Murphy's law takes effect. There were moments when I was genuinely on the edge of my seat, even though I should have known better, but anyway, the thrills still worked for me. The effects still hold up, and none of the performances disappoint. This is Week 13 of the Cult Movie Challenge, 70's Disaster Movie Week.",4,13,0,170,328,30-Mar-17,rated-7

Time hasn't exactly been kind to The Towering Inferno, what with the 9/11 attacks and the whole O. J. Simpson debacle making it potentially unpalatable for some, but the fact is it remains one of the best of the slew of 1970s disaster movies that came out of Hollywood, I mean, where the hell else are you going to see Paul Newman and Steve McQueen sharing the screen together? It lacks consistency and doesn't really justify its towering runtime but aside from a few silly plot contrivances it adheres to realism and authenticity, providing spectacle without the need to go overboard. The special effects were brilliant at the time and aside from a few primitive blue screen shots still hold up reasonably well today, a lasting triumph for Irwin Allen. As if McQueen and Newman wasn't enough, we also get William Holdem, Faye Dunaway, Jennifer Jones and Fred Astaire giving a wonderful twilight performance that earned him his one and only Oscar nomination. Certain subplots-of which there are many, are extraneous to the main action but the smart scripting keeps everything streamlined and ordered, a perfect blend of melodrama and fiery destruction. The film is rather impersonal and remains rigidly conventional at the hands of John Guillermin, who wasn't exactly a distinguished director, but his staging of scenes is deceptively intelligent and for sheer entertainment value, you could do a lot worse.

The story of The Towering Inferno is fairly standard Disaster movie stuff. Lots of people attend the opening of a brand new building that is at the height of technology and this goes badly wrong with the building catching fire and a small band of survivors having to find a way to escape whilst a heroic fireman and the architect of the building work together to save everyone. In truth The Towering Inferno offers absolutely nothing of note that’s in any way original or fresh and it does trot out all the old cliches that were already done in features such as Airport and The Poseidon Adventure. I think this is to be expected but it’s also a little disappointing at how formulaic it is as a feature. For a project with so much money behind it of course if would’ve been nice to see a fresher end product.  However the shortcomings of the plot it must be said are marvellously glossed over by the stunning production values and wonderful, stirring direction of John Guillermin who does a fantastic job of controlling the hectic action here. The special effects it must be said for the time are an extraordinary achievement and the fire is a frightening and relentless foe that genuinely thanks to the brilliant production values feels like a real, genuine threat throughout. Guillermin does amazing work here as well in building the suspense during this picture. The tension creeps up and up throughout the film as we try to guess as an audience which member of the all star cast is going to be burnt to a cinder next and the manner in which the threat escalates overtime and gradually overpowers the fire crew is incredible and a big success for Guillermin and his crew. The rescue attempts are also brilliantly orchestrated and all the action sequences are directed with genuine ferocity and energy that is impressive. The Towering Inferno has a terrifically cinematic quality to it thanks to the outstanding use of sound and great visual work which makes it all the more exciting. From a casting perspective there is a crazy array of talent featured here. As the heroic fire chief at the heart of the rescue Steve McQueen is at his most serious but also his most likeable as his character tries to take control of the dire situation he faces here. Paul Newman also does some excellent work here as the building’s architect giving a measured, subdued supporting performance. Some of the stars it would’ve been nice to see more of but players such as Robert Wagner, Robert Vaughn, William Holden and Faye Dunaway are typically reliable and their star quality really helps the film to be as entertaining as it is. Fred Astaire is also very good here coping very well it must be said in a role he wasn’t particularly used to playing. In conclusion, although The Towering Inferno offers nothing really new to cinema and treads the same ground other disaster epics did beforehand it nonetheless is a thrilling, tense, often nail-biting drama that thanks to brilliant, daring set pieces and the assured work of an experienced star-studded cast goes a long way to achieving its aim of being a memorable highlight of its genre.",5,41,0,"8,058","3,108",6-Jul-19,rated-7

Except that although the film quite rightly opens with a tribute to the bravery of the world's firefighters, who are putting their lives on the line every day, you have to ask what about the architects?  They're also out there risking their lives to save others, running through burning buildings, making death defying climbs to save small children, blowing shit up and generally being awesome. So come on guys, spare a thought for world's building designers.  If I'd seen this film when I was five all I would ever have wanted to do with my life was to have been an architect. But not an electrical sub-contractor because clearly they are all dicks, making themselves rich by cutting corners and greasing palms, cheating on their lovely young wives, getting drunk and trying to save their own lives by killing other people.

This had two main consequences: it fostered an early interest in cinema and it created the Holy Trinity of my child cinematic traumas : The Godfather, Jaws and The Towering Inferno. This last one is, for many, the best among the first wave of all-star catastrophe films. And, in retrospective, quite rightly so. Despite their long running time, it doesn't lose too much time engaging in dull stories about predictable family troubles. Of course, there are, but at least are kept to a reasonable minimum and connected to the plot. It also avoids being too moralist with the characters: good people die -sometimes unexpectedly- while others are not necessariily ‘punished’, or not the way we expect. That said, bad things tend to happen whem people do silly things. On the other side, the film as a whole has stood the test of time quite well. Part of it is due to the sheer magnitude of the production, with a wealthy budget (two big Studios, Fox and Warner, decided to collaborate instead of competing with similar projects). But it is also a consequence of good teamwork and coordination despite the big crew, the different sets and the mark of the producer, Irwin Allen, who directed himself the action sequences. The stars, particularly Newman, Dunaway, Holden and McQueen seem to be really into it, rather than thinking solely on the cheque. The result is mostly good because it is the fruit of collective effort and conviction rather than formula. Cuando cumplí los ocho años, mis padres me empezaron a llevar a sus salidas al cine sin mirar demasiado la clasificación por edades. Esto tuvo dos consecuencias principales: estimuló un interés temprano en el cine y generó la Santísima Trinidad de mis traumas cinematográficos: El Padrino, Tiburón y El Coloso en llamas. Este último es, para muchos, el mejor ejemplo de películas de desastres de la primera ola. Y, retrospectivamente, estoy deacuerdo. A pesar de su larga duración, no pierde ritmo ni se entretiene en explicarnos historias sin interés sobre problemas familiares predecibles. Por supuesto, los hay, pero al menos se mantienen a un mínimo razonable y siempre conectados a la trama. También consigue evitar ser excesivamente moral con los personajes: buenas personas mueren -a veces de forma inesperada-, mientras otros no son necesariamente ‘castigados’, o al menos no de la forma que esperamos. Dicho esto, cosas malas tienden a pasar cuando la gente hace estupideces. Por otro lado, la película en su conjunto se ha mantenido bastante bien. Parte es debido a la magnitud del proyecto en sí mismo y a su saludable presupuesto (dos trandes estudios, Fox y Warner, decidieron colaborar en lugar de competir con proyectos similares). Pero también es consecuencia de un buen trabajo en equipo y coordinación a pesar del gigantesco equipo, los numerosos sets y la marca impuesta por el productor Irwin Allen, quien dirigió él mismo las escenas de acción. Las estrellas, especialmente Newman, Holden, Dunaway, y McQueen parecen estar realmente en ello, más que pensar solo en el cheque. El resultado es mayoritariamente bueno por ser el fruto del esfuerzo colectivo más que una fórmula.",7,7,0,838,569,22-May-16,rated-8

""(McQueen sits down with a long loud sigh and proceeds to rub the back of his head while silently staring at the ground for 15 minutes).....well I guess we can set up a command center here."" But I guess if they put out the fire too quickly, we wouldn't have much of a movie, would we? Wow, okay, The Towering Inferno aka Your Pretty Skyscraper is Going to Hell, what a bloated messy overlong roller coaster ride you were, with the ups and downs coming not just from the excitement and suspense of the movie but also very much from its extreme unevenness! This movie's more divided against itself than Two-Face, so much so that I almost don't know where to begin. Maybe the first sign of trouble was when the opening credits informed me that this movie was based on two different novels by three different authors. We also get this jaw-dropping mixer of acting talent from the era listed in the cast (McQueen! Paul Newman!  Bill Holden! Faye Dunaway! Fred Astaire! Jennifer Jones! Richard Chamberlain! Both the staple-of-the-70's Roberts, Wagner  and Vaughn! Fucking O.J. Simpson!) along with a bunch of other people, and after a while it does feel like Towering Inferno is made out of two smaller movies that were crammed together, one with a cast of good actors, and the other not so much! But then a little longer after that even the old pros start giving some really terrible line readings, as they're forced to go through the motions while delivering all sorts of dumb and delusional dialogue with editing that frequently does them no favors. It's hard to believe while watching some of these scenes (and with this talented of a cast) that what we're seeing here in the final cut represents the best takes that they had filmed, but maybe it does! Maybe given the challenges of working in a pre-CGI era with a film built around pyrotechnics and the danger that involved and the financial costs incurred (to say nothing of also having to wrangle a massive cast filled with established celebrity actors that probably had limited patience for a lot of this) well then maybe what we're looking at really did represent the best they could do before moving on. But perhaps the real underlying issue here is that we have a film that has a much better grip on how to handle its technically-driven scenes than its emotionally-driven ones. And when it all comes down to it, the only performance in this film that really had to be exactly right was the tower's, and the tech side of the production did nail that. I dug the 70's modern skyscraper look of the set design and felt as though the filmmakers did a good job of making you feel like the action was happening dozens of stories up and not down on some ground floor soundstage. The sound design is rich and the pre-Jaws/Star Wars John Williams original score is effective. As a longtime appreciator of mattes & miniatures I enjoyed the film's efforts in that department too, I thought there was some great flaming stunt work in the second half, and in all fairness the entire cast does pretty well when they're caught in the thick of the action and not just standing around delivering dumb dialogue. And as much as I've complained about the clumsiness of the talky and less flame-oriented scenes, the film does get you familiar and emotionally invested enough with its characters during those parts that when we arrive at the much more competent scenes later on where these people are in obvious danger (and in some cases dying a horrible on-screen death) it turns out to be surprisingly emotionally affecting, and in at least one case absolutely devastating! It's not until the whole shithouse goes up in flames that the movie gets really effective... but I guess that's better than the opposite? The Towering Inferno is one of those movies I thought I'd already seen pretty much all of because I started watching it on TV when there was still two hours left of the runtime. Turns out I had missed a pretty good chunk of this 165 minutes scorcher from it's beginning and yet, honestly, I didn't really miss much. To its detriment, this movie was so much more than it needed to be in several different areas--with runtime perhaps chief among them--and yet I can't help but like it for what it does get right. Besides, seeing Paul Newman and Steve McQueen in the same movie together is like a Batman & The Punisher crossover of cool.

Possibly the finest example of a seventies disaster film alongside The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno stuck two of the three biggest Hollywood stars of the decade together in a fight to save hundreds of people from a fire in a newly-built skyscraper in San Francisco. Paul Newman and Steve McQueen play the architect and a fire-chief respectfully who both play their part in an epic race against time as the fire rages out of control engulfing the building. We have heroics from many quarters, and the usual cliche-ridden rich cowards, but it's the two main men who drive the film along. Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlain, William Holden, Fred Astaire, and the two Roberts, Vaughn and Wagner also have pivotal roles in a film that comes in at 165 minutes long. Bigger hero?

Although not a critical hit (and who cares what they think, anyway?), it was popular with the crowds, and rightly so. It's very tense, action-packed, with moments of humor, and always entertaining. The effects are super, even for 1974, and help the movie along. But without acting, where would the movie be? The acting is carried by big stars, especially Paul Newman & Steve McQueen. Also prominently billed are Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, Jennifer Jones, and Robert Vaughn.  I was pleased to be able to see this one twice at the cinema in 1974. So I invested in its chances at the next Academy Awards where it won three Oscars, for Best Song, Best Film Editing, and Best Cinematography.

Should it have been up for Best Picture in 1974? Absolutely not. Is it a truly entertaining film? Well, after 9/11, its rather tough to stomach at times. Do I wish that it was shorter? Definitely. Would I have changed some plot elements? Without a shadow of a doubt.  Is it a solid enough disaster film though? Yes, it is. It is the technical expertise, coupled with some Old Hollywood pizzazz that make it even get this high in my estimation. For a 43 year old film, its still quite scary and looks convincing. (Although maybe a bit too convincing. The scene in which Robert Wagner and Susan Flannery become human torches, and the horribly misguided scene in which Jennifer Jones, playing the film's most likable character and giving one of the best performances in the film in her final role, falls to her death from the scenic elevator are heartless and cruel.) But, in spite of all these reservations, The Towering Inferno always holds interest and is certainly an arresting viewing experience.  The acting standouts are Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones, who invest the film with emotional relevance. For Astaire, the film brought him his only Oscar nomination in his long career. I rejoice to say that  although he deserved to be nominated on many more occasions, his performance here was worthy of the nomination. The other performances run from the decent (Paul Newman, William Holden) to the purely routine (Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner) As for the technicals, John Williams' score is thrillingly good, and the sound and visual effects departments knocked themselves out. While far from an ideal film, The Towering Inferno is still worth a glance, at least for one viewing. PS: This is one of my grandmother's favorite films. she went to it 4 times during its original run, obviously loving it. I know her only reservation was their killing off Jennifer Jones.",10,5,0,"3,816","1,273",21-Mar-17,rated-7

Surprisingly, this film hasn't dated much at all. The special effects may not be as sophisticated as they are now, but a fire is a fire no matter when it was made. The exterior shots of the building, recreated in model form, also look surprisingly realistic and help prevent the film from looking like a cheap B-movie.  The thing that drew me in and got me to pick this film up was the cast. Starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, and featuring many other credible actors including Faye Dunaway and Fred Astaire, I knew at the very least that the performances would be at a good standard, and they didn't disappoint. Although the characters at a little thin in some cases, everybody does well to stay clear of melodrama and prevent the film from feeling ridiculous. The one huge issue with 'The Towering Inferno' is caused mostly by its excessive and unnecessary runtime. At 165 minutes long, this film needed a far more complex plot than 'a building is on fire' to sustain interest. Although there is drama and the opening half of the film is exciting, this film does start to drag and becomes a real bore by the end.  The film that this reminded me most of was 'Titanic', but the fact that this was not based on a true story meant that a lot of the tragic elements were lost. In 'The Towering Inferno' the viewer pretty much knows exactly what will happen to every character, whereas in 'Titanic' the writers had to be true to history, meaning that there was far more tragedy and a lot less predictable survival. Although 'The Towering Inferno' is well-made and surprisingly fresh considering the decade in which it was made, but a lack of interesting characters and a mammoth runtime makes it nothing more than a mediocre disaster movie.",6,6,0,0,696,17-Mar-13,0

I mean, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen is in this film, so they outshine a lot of the other cast members – although Fred Astaire’s character is plenty o’ memorable. In a film like this however, the building itself is almost the biggest character and it looks great, where the luxury apparent in every scene creates an interesting contrast to the awaiting destruction and the enclosed environments help the tension. In regards to the tension though, it’s very clear what the film builds up to and the attempts to have a small fire and go like “oh, lucky that didn’t go bad!” falls as flat as the attempts at critique against these kinds of skyscrapers. As things go crumbling however, the effects look great and do hold up well even to this day and creates a good sense of terror with burning people running around. It’s surprisingly powerful and creates good stakes for the tension, even though the individual characters gets sucked up in the big mass of people. Disaster-wise, The Towering Inferno is impressive tension even to this day and is crammed-full with excitement. Almost too much honestly, as the film eventually looses some focus and forgets about some characters, after a while it’s even unclear how much of a danger the people are in as the imminent threat of the fire isn’t enough to sustain throughout the huge length of the film. There’s some sincere acting in this and there’s plenty to admire throughout – but as a whole film, John Guillermin’s flick isn’t that strong as so many human fates disappears in the loong sea of fire and random people.",4,14,2,347,896,28-Mar-17,rated-6

Adapted from two books with two leading actors and two film crews from two studios, and yet it never feels like two different movies. It feels huge and packed with incident, but also unified, which could have been no easy task.  The production design is fantastic, visual effects hold up sturdily and often best what you see in movies today. Williams did a better job here than in The Poseidon Adventure, and this film won the Oscar for Best Cinematography (not that Oscars have any merit at all - The Godfather Part 2 wasn't even nominated! But somehow, Fred Astaire got a nod for Supporting Actor even though he had about 86 seconds of screen time and did absolutely fucking nothing with it - figure that one out on your own, because I'm stumped).  This is certainly not perfect, and I wouldn't even say it's special outside of the sheer spectacle of it all. There are a lot of wasted roles, particularly Faye Dunaway, who is given pretty much nothing to do, and Robert Vaughn's senator character, who is given even less to do.  But there is something undeniably energizing about the happy-sounding tune during the intro with the helicopter flying by as the opening credits listed all-star after all-star with multiple directors and cinematographers. Immediately, I knew I was in for a ride, and the film delivered in that respect tenfold.  That isn't a feeling newer films instill. New movies just feel like movies; this feels like an event of true significance. Even the runtime confirms this - you have to set aside enough time to watch this nearly 3-hour event.  Truth be told, I miss the kind of big-budget spectacle filmmaking that is treated (for the most part) seriously.

Requiring a gargantuan production to be pooled by both Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox—not to mention being based on two separate novels—The Towering Inferno is certainly not short on scope, stars or spectacle. Serving as a great proto-blockbuster for Hollywood, the film remains largely convincing and maintains its concentrated level of suspense, despite its exorbitant three-hour runtime, and exhibits some truly alarming stunt work and special effects. While Newman and, in particular, McQueen deliver brilliant everyman hero performances, some of the rest of the cast (Dunaway, Astaire, Vaughn, et al.) are underused and are clearly names to simply fill the poster; their purposes seems to be solely participating in incongruous romantic subplots or provide familiar faces seemingly worth caring for.

Two studios put it together (20th Century and Warner Bros.), two directors were credited (one for talking scenes, one for action scenes), it's based on two novels smooshed together, and they very intricately and carefully designed it for two superstar leads (Steve McQueen and Paul Newman) to anchor the film. It's documented that McQueen only signed on if him and Newman had the exact same number of lines in the script. Even on the poster it's unsure who actually has top billing. McQueen's name comes first if you're reading left to right, but Newman's name is positioned higher if you're prone to read top to bottom.  Every little proclivity appeared catered too and the result is a stuffy, sweaty, bloated turkey of a movie in glorious 70s fashion and trends. Personally, The Poseidon Adventure and Airport remain the gold standard for big ensemble disaster spectaculars and it was their successes that led to this one attempting to go bigger and better and it succeeded in its day, commercially and critically, even managing to secure a Best Picture Oscar nod, which is rather shocking looking back at all the forward-thinking and challenging films of 1974 (Inferno is a steaming joke next to  Chinatown and The Conversation at Oscar night). Yet, as a 70s artifact of blockbuster cheese, it's hard to beat the enormity of the tower itself, the miniature work, the matte paintings, the explosions, Paul Newman dangling from high heights. There is a charm intact but it is not a movie that holds up and goddamn it, nor should it hold up.

It holds up remarkably well - tacky 70s fashions and the lamentable presence of O.J.

Paul Newman (Hero 1) is the architect who designed the building. He quickly learns that the electrical engineer (Richard Chamberlain) cut corners installing the tower's electrical system to save money, with no objection from the greedy entrepreneur who owns the building (William Holden). Pretty soon there are explosions going off everywhere, with plate glass shattering and burning bodies careening helplessly toward cement. The fire department are called to stop the blaze, which is where we meet Steve McQueen (Hero 2), the fire chief who thinks architects like Newman should be put out of commission for building these monstrosities and putting peoples' lives at risk. The two men (naturally) forge an unlikely friendship under dire circumstances and do their best to keep the body count down.  This is a 'spectacle' movie and on that score it delivers. Even today the effects (which are not computer animated) hold up well, and it is fun to watch a disaster on this scale unfold. The only dated aspect are the melodramatic and pointless subplots given to each of the 'important' cast members, which needlessly stretch the movie's running time out to 165 minutes.  This is the kind of movie where the hero gets stuck with a young boy (named Timmy or Billy) and says things like, 'Look after the women, Timmy or Billy. I'm counting on you.' And the little boy smiles, glad to be charged with an important task. It is A-Grade Ham, completely ridiculous and bubbling with cliches. But the building does crackle, burn and explode. And that is what you came to see, after all.  There is a moment when Faye Dunaway tries to give up her precious place on the elevator to her friend.

I love a disaster film.  💕The Good: Once it finally got going it was edge of your seat stuff. Rather brutal and hard to watch at times. Exciting stuff.  Some great characters and acting from most involved. Steve McQueen and Paul Newman were definite standouts and Richard Chamberlain was superbly vile as Simmons.  Effects were great for the time. My heart was in my throat when the lift was getting picked up by the helicopter.  💩The Bad: Took quite a while to get going and was that indulgent film run time really necessary.. A fire in that room would not take that long to do some damage.  Characters made some stupid frustrating mistakes... arrrgh  😍Eye Candy: Robert Wagner and William Holden (was a shock to see him so old but I probably still would ha ha)  So overall a rather great disaster film that for me was let down by its run time because When it was good it was REALLY good.,11,6,0,755,740,29-Sep-19,rated-8

Like most of them, this has a who's who of the 70's (now seen by people under 20 as simply ""who?"").  McQueen and Newman are great as the two leads, Dunaway is pushed to the background for some reason, and we have dueling old couples vying for our sympathy (Fred Astaire and Jennifer Jones are clearly the better ones). With this viewing, I found myself not liking it as much as I did during my first viewing.  I think most of it has to do with the fact that it does everything that every other 70's disaster movie does (and does it well), but over a longer running time.  The end result is that it tends to overstay its welcome here and there. Even with a bloated runtime, the soap-opera style character plots and surprisingly solid special effects (maybe not the super-imposed shots) put this towards the top of the sub-genre.

This screwball 1930s romantic comedy follows the aftermath of a divorce where a married couple suspected that both of them were cheating on each other and do their best to foil each others' attempts to find new romance along the way. Irene Dunne and Cary Grant are impressive in this and it's some of the comedy is fine and it's easy to see why it's regarded as a classic. Romantic comedies aren't normally my thing but I this was something that I couldn't help but like, even if it is too predictable at times and just by glancing at the summary you'd be right in guessing the end result that this movie is leading up to.  It still has its charms though and although it's not quite a favourite there are a lot of worse movies out there. The chemistry between the two leads is both good and they put in memorable performances, and there are several moments of great comedy to be had over the runtime and the film's pace for the most part is solid enough and there are plenty of laughs to keep audiences engaged. Leo McCarey is definitely a director whose work I'll want to watch more of in the near future and if you like older comedies and haven't seen this one then it's worth checking out.  I've yet to be really let down by a film that I've watched on Mubi so far as this was another impressive entry to their catalogue that is unfortunately expiring tonight.",4,12,0,"1,639","1,775",14-Mar-17,rated-8

The Awful Truth sees unfounded suspicions lead a married couple (Irene Dunne & Cary Grant) to begin divorce proceedings, whereupon they start undermining each other's attempts to find new romance. Having seen the excellent His Girl Friday (also starring Cary Grant) I was looking forward to seeing how this earlier film would deliver in the ‘screwball’ style. Whilst not as fast paced or eccentric as the aforementioned film, this still is a thoroughly entertaining comedy with some great slapstick and physical comedy, witty dialogue and a likeable engaging cast of characters.  The film is essentially a series of embarrassing, petty and playful situations as the two leads try to one up the other and make the other feel jealous at their new romantic endeavours, even though (as you will have guessed) they still really love each other. There are some aspects of the plot that feel a bit rushed, the initial decision for a divorce and Jerry’s new relationship with Barbara in the final third of the film. That being said the comedic elements and character dialogue very much overshadow this. There is some very funny scenarios throughout. With Jerry’s smug and subtle Mickey-taking of Lucy’s potential new life with Oklahoma farm owner Daniel providing consistent entertainment only for the tables to turn when Lucy shows up when Jerry is meeting Barbara’s family. Their dog ‘Mr. Smith’ is a constant source of humour as well, incredibly well trained and smart, his look of bewilderment and enthusiasm as Jerry and Lucy argue over who he truly belongs to and his constant barking and jumping movements in the brilliant section where Lucy is hiding both Jerry and her piano instructor (who she may or may not have had a fling with) from Daniel is one of the film’s best scenes. As many have said before this is the film that truly established Cary Grant’s film persona and leading man casting. He delivers the funny, charming and quick witted performance of Jerry very well. He also has great chemistry with Irene Dunne who more than matches him as Lucy who constantly manages to work her way around situations and come out on top throughout. Ralph Bellamy & Alexander D’Arcy also give strong supporting performances. The Awful Truth is another excellent screwball comedy. Featuring great enthusiastic performances, entertaining and clever comedic situations and an easy to watch pacing. Though at times it can feel a bit rushed and does have a few predictable elements. Still well worth a watch.",6,5,0,148,226,6-Aug-20,rated-8

What I seem to be doing at the moment with my filmwatching is starting to plug some holes in my cinematic knowledge. It has been inadvertent but I had noticed that particular pattern had emerged in the last few weeks or so. What with me having broken my Paul Thomas Anderson duck last night, making vague noises about watching more musicals, and even dipped my toe into Japanese noir, I now find myself tackling the screwball comedy. I know, sometimes I surprise even myself. Truth be told, The Awful Truth just happened to be a title that caught my eye - like I say, completely inadvertent. I have ventured into these waters a couple of times in the past and most notably on one of those occasions for another Cary Grant classic, the lovely His Girl Friday. But I'm obviously no stranger to his work overall, especially having worked my way through all the sound era Hitchcocks relatively recently. Even after seeing hardly any of Grant's earlier romantic comedies, watching him dealing with his mother and enforced intoxication amongst other things in North By Northwest, I did wonder if Hitchcock was giving a bit of a nod and a wink to the run of films where Grant really made his name. There are definite elements of that performance in his performance here. In terms of how he matches up to Irene Dunne, the wife he is in the process of divorcing after suspecting that she may have been guilty of behaviour somewhat unbecoming of a married lady, this is a film that you can cut cleanly into three parts. The first third sees them play off each other marvellously, especially during a splendid courtroom scene where they fight over custody of their pet dog. The middle third sees Grant take centre stage as he delights in watching Dunne realise the terrible error of her ways in rebounding into an engagement with rich Oklahoman Ralph Bellamy, who is absolutely splendid here. For the final third, however, Dunne completely steals the film with a turn of physical, verbal and even musical comedy that is as funny as it is an absolutely inspired performance. Watching Grant become her straight man and watching her let off the comedic leash is a joy to behold, but the same can be said of pretty much the whole film anyway. Although trading on subtle wordplay and occasional bouts of slapstick to keep the humour going as you would expect from this kind of film, it is also delightfully caustic at times - her lawyer, Mitchell Harris, telling his wife to shut her big mouth was as unexpected as it was bloody hilarious. It is perhaps a little bit too predictable for its own good at times and you know where it is going right from the outset. However, the ending is slightly ambiguous, which was rather a nice surprise, and it's just a joy from start to finish. Anchored by two marvellous lead performances, it's every bit as charming and funny as I hoped it would be.",9,49,2,469,"10,150",22-Aug-13,rated-8

But this has become a serious contender for my favorite comedy ever; I really can't think of a better one, though perhaps a few are its equal. One thing I love here is how part of the film's narrative involves Grant and Dunne finding their specific class niche; Grant helps Dunne realize that they are too snobbish and cultured for the Oklahoma businessman, and Dunne helps Grant realize that they are too rebellious for the uppity New York aristocrats. Thus we see, in the two halves of the film, comedy punching down and comedy punching up in a kind of perfect balance with each other. The message either way is the same: the utopian possibility of comedy as a means of uniting two people must exist in tandem with comedy's need for targets, for others against whom the couple can define themselves.

Brilliant. Leo McCarey's The Awful Truth pairs together Cary Grant and Irene Dunne for the first of three films the pair made together in the late 1930s/early 1940s. The most revered of the three - having been preserved by the National Film Registry and now subject to Criterion Collection rumors - The Awful Truth has Grant and Dunne portraying Jerry and Lucy Warriner. Married, but cheating on one another, the two suspect the other and wind up getting divorced. Having to split everything up, including beloved dog Mr. Smith (Skippy, of The Thin Man and Bringing Up Baby fame), the pair head their separate ways but are hardly separated. Instead, they continue to play a large part in one another's life while awaiting the finalization of the divorce. Turning breaking up their ex's new relationship into a sport, The Awful Truth is an incredibly funny, witty, and immensely charming watch. As in his other film appearances, Skippy the dog consistently charms in this film and is used to absolute perfection. Forced to choose which parent he wants to go with, the good boy naturally goes with the one who has the ball in their hand, Lucy. However, his energy and charm keeps drawing them together. Coming over to play with Mr. Smith, the dog engages in games of hide-and-seek and even barks along to the piano, a truly gorgeous rendition. Consistently funny, the gags and running jokes with Mr. Smith always add great comedic punch to the film that the rest of the film consistently feeds off of. Whenever the film threatens to slow down or hit a comedic dead spot, director Leo McCarey turns to his true star, Skippy, to bring the house down with laughter. The gags are certainly appealing because of how cute the dog is, to be sure, but the scenes are also quite funny and often lead into other strong gags by the human actors. One such example is when Mr. Smith grabs the wrong hat for Jerry, revealing that Lucy is hiding another man in the apartment. Too big for Jerry's head, he tries nonetheless to make it fit. Funny and well played by Grant, the scene is kicked off by a great game of hide-and-seek by Mr. Smith that Skippy was born to bring to life. As with any screwball comedy, The Awful Truth does largely rely upon its actors to sell the one-liners and, nearly without fail, they do so. Witty and ripe with sly side remarks, The Awful Truth is one of those screwball comedies that just ages like a fine wine. Each line has great zip and punch to it that comedies nowadays seem to lack, relying upon the timing and delivery of the actors instead of some over-the-top bit of slapstick. The few times the film does rely upon physical comedy - Jerry breaking a chair, Jerry fighting Armand (Alexander D'Arcy), and Jerry opening the door to Lucy's bedroom - it nails it just as with the witty one-liners. Grant was always a tremendous physical comedian and, in screwball comedies, he was right at home. Allowed to use his charismatic demeanor, sharp wit, and ability to make physical gags come off perfectly, Grant was a man born to shine to screwball comedies. The Awful Truth plays to all of these strengths and the end result is a film that consistently nails its comedic targets. In terms of its romance, Grant and Dunne continuously click. Comically, obviously, the two play off of one another perfectly as they try to ruin the other's relationships with subtle jabs or demonstrative performances. As a romantic pairing, however, the two are perfect together throughout. This is really defined at the end of the film when they finally, as anyone could predict would happen, admit they love one another. Saying it with their eyes and body language, the two have this easy appeal to them that makes their mutual passion for one another quite obvious. While both can be rather impulsive and petty, it is obvious that the two are meant for one another. Grant and Dunne's comedic chemistry turns into perfect romantic chemistry as a result, turning The Awful Truth into not just a truly hysterical screwball comedy, but also a really heart warming and touching romance. The Awful Truth is one of those screwball comedies that is just so easy to fall head-over-heels in love with. Funny, packed with screwball zip and banter, and relying on that oh-so-innocent 1930s comedic energy, The Awful Truth is a sharply written film with terrific comedic actors taking the pitch perfect script and bringing it to life. Consistently funny with few (or possibly no) swings-and-misses, The Awful Truth is a classic in every sense of the word and represents what makes screwball comedy such an excellent genre: funny, charming, light, romantic, and packed with the constant suggestion that something could happen behind closed doors between these two characters.

In fact, it’s his distrust of Irene Dunn that undergirds the movie, the “awful truth” he fears. But our two leads are never anything less than extraordinarily charming and quick-witted, the saucy banter between Dunn and Grant almost unbearable. What elevates this beyond just being a splendid, hilarious comedy of remarriage (and one of the first examples of its kind, to boot) is that Leo McCarey has a way of treating everyone with humanity. Ralph Bellamy’s lovable oaf is a fall guy for laughs but never mocked; Dunn’s fun-loving Aunt Patsy, played by Cecil Cunningham, is never judged for her hobbies; and McCarey never feels obligated to explain Dunn’s ambiguous relationship with her hysterical music teacher. The highs of The Awful Truth streak through like sunlight: Dunn’s shimmering comic touch, Grant’s patented physical comedy, the overwhelming, Pre-Code sexiness of the film’s final moments, and a brilliant, adorable performance from famous canine actor Skippy.

McCarey's no slouch, either, and while he's not quite operating at Duck Soup levels of comic density yet, he still manages to load up his work with some fairly ahead-of-their-time jokes, particularly when it comes to the abundance of great audio gags on display here (Dunne trying to make awkward small talk as Grant and Alexander D'Arcy noisily brawl just slightly out of sight is funny enough to deserve a place in a Chuck Jones cartoon).

Sure, it would be easy enough to say from the offset that it looks incredibly cute but what it is that makes The Awful Truth stand apart from your typical screwball comedy aside from perhaps having set a standard for the genre would be the many boundaries which it pushes for its time. And to this day, it still amazes me how much had McCarey managed to get away with in this film. Cary Grant stars as Jerry Warriner, married to Lucy Warriner - who is played by Irene Dunne. They are planning to get divorced, despite how happy they believe themselves to be, but Jerry also requires visitation rights for the couple’s own dog. Before their divorce has been made official, they decide that they will get engaged to others - but with a twist coming in the ways of their own romantic affairs because they also proposed to ruin both of their own dates. This isn’t an idea that sounds like it would be too far off from a typically cheesy romantic comedy that you would find today, but among many other reasons as to why The Awful Truth still manages to stand atop most romantic comedies because of the ideas that it celebrates especially given the time period in which it was made. But McCarey has always been a master with comedic filmmaking back in the day, and with a film like this, it’s not hard to see why. There’s never a moment in The Awful Truth that loses a single bit of energy, but it’s also what helps make every moment of it feel believable. You already find yourself believing the romantic pairing of Grant and Dunne first from the way in which their performances are directed. Having built itself largely from improvisation, it shows that Grant and Dunne have really lost themselves into the characters which they have played but also because of the way McCarey guides them through the absurd nature of the scenarios which they get themselves embroiled within, but in creating a great screwball comedy you also need to have the instincts of its own characters being questioned by the exaggerated nature of their own positions in life, and how they also are in part responsible for what they brought themselves into. This is a comedy based around the concept of remarriage, given as it focuses on a couple that plan to divorce - all because of how suspicious they are of one another. It’s so easy enough to take a concept like that and wear it so thin, but The Awful Truth allows itself to build up more as a great social commentary, ridiculing societal norms especially when they try to dictate the way one lives their own lives. There are many ways in which the film has aged well as a great romantic comedy, but it’s also worth noting that the film’s satire biting at gender roles in society still manages to stick its landing even today. McCarey was a director who always sought to break boundaries and The Awful Truth manages to break so many on the spot it’s astounding because this is a film that seems like it only could have been made to tell a story about the privileged but even these characters still are drawn beautifully through their own instincts - especially when you consider the way that Cary Grant plays a position that would normally be taken on by a woman in this sort of romantic comedy, being the spouse who is humiliated by the state of their own love affairs. But in the ways that McCarey keeps everything discreet, tapping into this also delves greatly into what you know these people really feel like if they are forced to behave one way because that’s what everyone expects of them, no matter who’s wrong - but here, everyone is bitten in some way or another and that’s what makes it so enjoyable. The Awful Truth is not an easy film to repeat, no matter what it may sound like - because it would be hard to replicate the many joys of hearing such snappy one-liners coming right out from the mouths of any other pair of actors that isn’t Cary Grant or Irene Dunne nor would oneself ever feel present within the scenario the way that Leo McCarey makes you feel as you watch the couple only realizing what it that they love about one another. But perhaps if there really was an awful truth that needed to be discussed, The Awful Truth wasn’t even the best Leo McCarey film to come out in 1937, and yet that doesn’t have much bearing on the quality of the film itself because it’s still quite incredible to think that it was a film from the period in which it had been made. The funniest thing to think about when watching The Awful Truth comes forth when you consider that maybe it was the fact that it took a couple to hate each other to realize they actually love each other.",5,21,0,"1,347","6,791",19-Jun-18,rated-9

What I seem to be doing at the moment with my filmwatching is starting to plug some holes in my cinematic knowledge. It has been inadvertent but I had noticed that particular pattern had emerged in the last few weeks or so. What with me having broken my Paul Thomas Anderson duck last night, making vague noises about watching more musicals, and even dipped my toe into Japanese noir, I now find myself tackling the screwball comedy. I know, sometimes I surprise even myself. Truth be told, The Awful Truth just happened to be a title that caught my eye - like I say, completely inadvertent. I have ventured into these waters a couple of times in the past and most notably on one of those occasions for another Cary Grant classic, the lovely His Girl Friday. But I'm obviously no stranger to his work overall, especially having worked my way through all the sound era Hitchcocks relatively recently. Even after seeing hardly any of Grant's earlier romantic comedies, watching him dealing with his mother and enforced intoxication amongst other things in North By Northwest, I did wonder if Hitchcock was giving a bit of a nod and a wink to the run of films where Grant really made his name. There are definite elements of that performance in his performance here. In terms of how he matches up to Irene Dunne, the wife he is in the process of divorcing after suspecting that she may have been guilty of behaviour somewhat unbecoming of a married lady, this is a film that you can cut cleanly into three parts. The first third sees them play off each other marvellously, especially during a splendid courtroom scene where they fight over custody of their pet dog. The middle third sees Grant take centre stage as he delights in watching Dunne realise the terrible error of her ways in rebounding into an engagement with rich Oklahoman Ralph Bellamy, who is absolutely splendid here. For the final third, however, Dunne completely steals the film with a turn of physical, verbal and even musical comedy that is as funny as it is an absolutely inspired performance. Watching Grant become her straight man and watching her let off the comedic leash is a joy to behold, but the same can be said of pretty much the whole film anyway. Although trading on subtle wordplay and occasional bouts of slapstick to keep the humour going as you would expect from this kind of film, it is also delightfully caustic at times - her lawyer, Mitchell Harris, telling his wife to shut her big mouth was as unexpected as it was bloody hilarious. It is perhaps a little bit too predictable for its own good at times and you know where it is going right from the outset. However, the ending is slightly ambiguous, which was rather a nice surprise, and it's just a joy from start to finish. Anchored by two marvellous lead performances, it's every bit as charming and funny as I hoped it would be.",9,49,2,469,"10,150",22-Aug-13,rated-8

The Awful Truth is kind of like Alfred Hitchcock's Mr. and Mrs. Smith, which came later, but it's not nearly as dark and sinister... even though that's a comedy, too. It's hard not to suspect an influence, as The Awful Truth even has a dog named Mr. Smith! It's also hard not to suspect that Marilyn Monroe was a fan of this film. Just watch and you'll see what I mean. Influences aside, The Awful Truth on its own is a delight from director Leo McCarey, who earlier in the year made a film that could make stones cry, at least that's what Orson Welles said (and I concur). Irene Dunne stuns and (literally) sparkles as Lucy Warriner, and Cary Grant pulls off comedy while not having to catch his breath. The supporting players are truly wonderful, which always seems to be the case in screwball comedies, and Cecil Cunningham as Aunt Patsy seems to have gotten the best zingers out of anyone.

What I know of her I know very little, and now having seen her act I would like to know a lot more.  In the last act of this film she is a woman possessed, doing her damnedest to haywire her ex-husband's attempts at a new relationship. To be fair her ex-husband (played by Grant) did Dunne no favors in the first half of the film with her attempts to move on.  The fault with the film is that is does feel like a movie of two halves, both comedy, just slightly different tones. But the halves are different enough that it makes the movie feel a bit too uneven for my liking (poor Ralph Bellamy simply disappears, though with a great last line). But being uneven, being of two halves... well I suppose that's appropriate for a comedy about divorce.  Faults aside, Grant is wonderful (I buy into his act all the time).

I will not because it will be my record of my initial impressions of the 3/4 of the film that I saw. My biggest mistake, I think, was going in expecting a screwball. My 2nd mistake was seeing it right after Bringing Up Baby. At least I didn't also watch His Girl Friday before this one. At least there is that. The pacing in this one is way too slow, the dialogue hardly witty and I couldn't see any chemistry between any of the characters at all. The introduction of 3 slapstick moments, having Grant trip and fall, or fall out of a chair was, in my eyes, a hail Mary pass. A failed one. I kept thinking that perhaps the timing issue had less to do with the director than with the editor. Perhaps Leo McCarey was adding pauses everywhere so that the editor had more room to cut the film and make it flow better, but that didn't happen. I think it was Monkey Business that had the same issue. Reading reviews here it seems that the third act is something special. I quit just as Irene Dune was to come pose as Grant's sister. Perhaps I missed the best part. It is truly amazing how a great last act can wipe out one's memory of preceding acts.  On the other hand, many here describe the first few acts as pretty grand, so maybe I will just call it a difference in expectations and leave it at that.",6,11,8,318,"4,899",5-Apr-14,rated-4

Viña Delmar’s vivacious and enthusiastically comical screenplay pushes along at a taut pace under the ingenious proficiency of editor Al Clark, and McCarey displays his conventional tenderness and warmth for his characters from start to finish.

There is too much fraternizing with the enemy.” ― Henry Kissinger The only Screwball Comedy I had seen before now was His Girl Friday. It was a real doozy of a film, a thrilling depiction of a highly entertaining battle between a divorced couple, played by Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as they go at it hammer and tongs. It felt like I had court-side seats to a tennis open grand final as the couple traded verbal zingers back and forth with panache and force until one of them lobbed up an opportunity for the other one to slam down a stinging punchline back across the net. Each actor's verbal delivery was sharp as a tack and the chemistry between the both of them absolutely sizzled. Unfortunately, the interplay in The Awful Truth between Cary Grant and Irene Dunne's characters, Jerry and Lucy, is more fizzle than sizzle. It was rather like a game of badminton where each time they feebly struck the shuttlecock it failed to even reach the net. Not so much the fault of the actors, instead, I think the shuttlecock was missing a few feathers. This demonstrates that when it comes to Screwball Comedy, the script is king, and in this respect the film is a bit of a lame duck. The dialogue lacks the wit and sophistication of His Girl Friday leaving the actors with little room to really turn up the heat. The set up is also a little too simple and lacks meat.  I am exaggerating quite a bit I guess, especially considering that it was pretty damn popular at the time. A better way to approach this film would be to suggest that it is Screwball Lite, rather than Bad Screwball. In retrospect, His Girl Friday, a film released at a much more mature moment during the Screwball movement, set a standard that is unfair to apply to all that came before it (and quite possibly after it).  Although both of these films may appear on first blush to be about the acrimonious fall out of a divorce or separation, they actually end up being more about re-marriage. Ultimately, these couples are inexorable soul mates that cannot escape one another's orbit, the gravity of their unique personalities draw them back together no matter how far their conflicting egos propel them apart. Of course, a big part of the fun is that while we sit on the lounge cursing their stupidity at lacking the insight to know this, it is deeply satisfying when they finally come to their senses and fall back together in each other's arms. Sort of. On some level I found the endings of both films a little disappointing. I loved the fact that both women depict strong, smart and sexy characters in these films, women that defy the roles that society would assign to them and ultimately have the courage to not give a toss about others expectations. It is certainly a more positive image of women that in some later films. For instance, in Noir, the post-war Rosie the Riveter, with her new found sense of agency struck fear into the heart of men, manifesting itself in the femme fatale archetype. These were women that hid within the household, behind the bar or shop counter or waited by the side of the road. They seduced men, deceiving them and luring them unto their own self-destruction.  In this sense, if Noir is more like guerrilla warfare, then Screwball Comedy is more like open warfare, conducted out in the open in front of friends, in the workplace and at the hip jazz clubs of the age. All is fair in love and war, and everything is above the table. But at the end of the film it is almost like that in addition to realising they were in love and perfect for one another all along, the woman folds her cards and happily assumes the conventional role of a typical wife. This is probably a sign of the times and I think I am overthinking it. I am sure that once the glow of their renewed passion for one another wears off they will spend the rest of their days bickering and arguing happily ever after as they jostle one another for dominance on any given day. Actually, one of the reasons I found The Awful Truth less interesting compared to His Girl Friday is that the latter films character Hildy is a career journalist. This adds a whole new layer and makes it feel way ahead of its time. Not only is it just a look at the politics of women in the workplace, it is also a general examination of professional work, the call of a vocational passion and it's necessity for those that hear the beat of it's drum. This is work as a significant force in our lives and it asks the question of how much does it cost us to sit on the sidelines instead of strapping on the harness and entering the race, which having said that it is not just political, even in this regards the politicss are obviously crucial when it comes to the limits of power that women have in society. Sometimes, I get confused because having grown up a man and being indoctrinated into sexist attitudes, they are embedded so deep that sometimes I don't even see them for what they are. In comparison, in The Awful Truth it would seem that the major stakes that Lucy stands to lose are her fancy stores, her fancy clothes, her fancy friends, and the fancy night clubs that appear to be her sole vocation. While it certainly motivates her growing hesitancy for marrying her new doltish and dopey partner, Daniel and moving back to the mid-west as his country bumpkin wife, it makes for a much more shallow plot. It is not that such aims are invalid or less important, that is not for me to judge, but if that is all there is revealed to us about her, then it certainly gives you a lot less to chew on. Rather than making the film laser focused on any one thing, the movie is rendered a little bit more like simple confectionery. Considering that we are also introduced to her draped in a massive and presumably incredibly expensive fur coat at a time when many families were left out in the cold to starve during the Great Depression, it is also a shame that there was very little in the way of social commentary in this regard,  Other than to provide them with the added luxury to spend all day trying to sabotage one another and endlessly bitch and moan. Once, again I suspect that His Girl Friday spoilt this for me again as it also fits in other themes as well, such as corruption and justice.  I am assuming that the term Screwball Comedy is fitting because the characters are rather eccentric in the sense that they eschews societal mores and are quite happy to follow their own rules leaving everyone around them baffled, horrified or completely ignorant. It kind of reminds me of Homer where the arrogant and selfish gods go about their marital spats only acknowledging mere mortals when manipulating them to be used like pawns against their spouses. On that note the film does a good job of drawing us in so that we feel like we are on the level with Jerry and Lucy making us feel like we are cut above the rest and that we are in on the joke. However, when they make their jokes at others expense, especially when those people are completely unaware, it does feel quite mean-spirited. In addition to all of the above, some of the comedy simply comes down to some decent slapstick, some times rather unexpected (Jujitsu? Where did that come from?). Combined with everything mention above, Cary Grant's usual flair, Irene Dunne's beauty and sass, and a decent supporting cast, this film turns out to be not so bad. I have always been attracted to mind over mammaries, so my kink for smart and independent women was certainly satisfied, although I suspect that is a remark that flies in the face of some of the comments I made above, in numerous ways... So, there you go. There wasn't much screwing and there weren't no balling but it was still OK.

But the little moments add up too, particularly Grant's expression to Dunne when saying ""Yes I guess people did see us before the divorce.""

Why can't real life be just this easy, this witty, this effity jeffity effortless???? A simple tale of man and woman marry, take each other for granted, divorce and realise they actually do love each other. But when the man is one Archibald Leach and the woman is the adorable Irene Dunn, well, bugger me, if it's not just the utter purest fucking joy. Unlike some of Grant's other famous screwball comedies, this doesn't have the rat-a-tat dialogue, it doesn't have the contrived backdrop or context, it's relatively straight forward. But every second sparkles with an ease and a casual swagger to it that seems to come from the almost wholly improvised approach the director took to making the film. Even the secondary characters - snarky cougar Aunty Patsy, effete sex machine Armand and even dumb ol' southern boy Ralph 'one of the Duke's' Bellamy - jump right on board and every line, every wonderful physical pratfall oozes the same kind of easy charm that our superb leading pair have. Even with some of the more contrived sequences - the classic ""quick hide in the bedroom as I don't want him to see you"", the not quite so classic ""hello, don't look surprised I'm really your imaginary sister"" - just feel smooth and easy (that word again) and for 90 glorious minutes, you're just swept up with everyone as the film hooks you in and along for the ride. Even when it mildly annoys - the set up of Grant and Dunne never gives enough to make you believe they want to divorce - it even manages to give that a depth that takes the annoyance away: I'm pretty sure Dunne didn't cheat, but did Grant? Why didn't he go to Florida? Even if I do want to know, it just rounds out these two even more - no-one's fucking perfect after all. If I ever come across a golden ticket that lets me (and not a fucking annoying teen) get sucked into the movies, this is the movie I want to be sucked into. But only if I can be Cary Grant.

Viña Delmar’s vivacious and enthusiastically comical screenplay pushes along at a taut pace under the ingenious proficiency of editor Al Clark, and McCarey displays his conventional tenderness and warmth for his characters from start to finish. The facial expressions of its cast are frequently more chucklesome than some of their dialogue, and the couple’s dog Skippy, who was also Asta in The Thin Man, delightfully round off the film to be an irresistible slice of entertainment.",3,42,1,"6,764","12,333",9-Oct-20,rated-8

Je ne sais pas pourquoi je l’ai retrouvé par cette œuvre, d’autant plus que j’apprends par Letterboxd l’avoir regardé il y a 2 mois jour pour jour.  Cavell disait que de toutes les comédies du remariage, The Awful Truth était le film dont l’appréciation dépendait le plus des conditions de visionnement. Je pense être d’accord. C’était la première fois que je l’écoutais sans sous-titre et je ne l’ai jamais trouvé aussi drôle et touchant, un peu comme si tout le génie, la subtilité et la simplicité du film surgissaient pour la première fois devant mes yeux.  Je persiste à croire deux choses. Premièrement, les comédies de remariages sont d’incroyables exposés sur la manière dont nous pouvons instrumentaliser l’embarras social pour parvenir à nos fins. Autrement dit, ces œuvres nous apprennent qu’il y a du bon dans la transgression et que travailler ensemble pour sauver (ou détruire) une représentation sociale est l’exercice idéal pour développer une complicité. Deuxièmement, Cary Grant est l’un des grands talents comiques de l’histoire du cinéma. Le film est en grande partie improvisé, mais ses gestes restent extrêmement précis. Il appert très rapidement qu’il est rompu aux arts comiques (auxquels, ne l’oublions pas, il s’est initié dès l’adolescence – sa formation est impeccable et n’a rien à envier aux autres grands génies comiques). Parce qu’il s’est avéré que cet homme avait un physique non moins extraordinaire que son talent comique, la légende retient d’abord sa sophistication et sa suavité. Mais combien d’acteurs peuvent prétendre avoir eu l’influence de Cary Grant sur un genre comique comme lui sur la comédie romantique? Très, très, très peu. Et pour cette raison, il ne me semble absolument pas scandaleux de mentionner Cary Grant parmi Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin ou Woody Allen dans les grands artistes comiques du cinéma.",3,14,3,67,76,17-May-20,rated-10

Probably an inevitable case of pupils bettering the master- measured 30s elegance doesn't quite suit the genre, which would be perfected in the chaos of Howard Hawks and the satire of Preston Sturges. (And that's a deeper hole I'm digging- McCarey, one of the founding influences of screwball comedy, is no slouch, having made this film in his mindblowing 1930s run and in the same year as Make Way for Tomorrow.)  But now to undermine my big defense- I'll enjoy anything with even a degree of measured 30s elegance, and this is at least a right angle. (Especially enjoy the film's enlightened portrayal of Dunn's spinster aunt, who's fun-loving and isn't judged for it. Not something one sees outside of this decade.) And the third act is really something, going full It Happened One Night with the back and forth between the two bedrooms, the creaky door that just won't stay shut, the cuckoo clock with the jig-dancing dolls. Best discovery was Ralph Bellamy's willingness to efface his persona even before His Girl Friday. (His singing is hysterical.) Guy was a sport.",2,6,0,197,112,7-May-17,rated-7

It's also identifiably cinephilic in a way Stillman's early cinema preferred to keep under its sleeve (He synthesizes this eye for the more flamboyant composition in such a lovely manner with his follow-up  LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP).

Well in the case of suicide, it's ten tenths the cure. Whit Stillman is back, and is slightly happier than before. His dialogue remains as wryly hilarious as ever, he never forces a punchline but always gets a laugh. This is a frothy counterpart to Metropolitan and a joy for it. I laughed loads throughout, though the last 30 minutes have a lot fewer jokes than the first hour, and it is even better a few hours removed from the film thinking about all of the great little vignettes. It will not be to everyone's taste, it is a little prim and the dialogue is somewhat fussy, but if it hits your sense of humour then you will be in for a treat. Stillman has one of the great bodies of work in cinema, with four almost perfectly constructed films. Out of the four lead actresses, it is probably Analeigh Tipton who steals the movie, though Greta Gerwig as the film's lead is pretty good; but the best performance in the film comes from Adam Brody, who steals a lot of laughs.

Which is not to say that the first three weren't knowing, but they do seem to me almost incidentally comedic, whereas Damsels is very much a Comedy, with bons mots shading into bona fide one-liners. Fortunately, the laughs are there, though he doesn't know how to write buffoons—struggling to imagine someone witless and uncouth, he comes up with a guy who denies that his eyes are blue, observing that he (the doofus) doesn't view the world through a blue filter. (Which actually is kinda funny, but I can too readily conjure up the more self-aware version Stillman would have written in the '90s, when it would have been a riff rather than a gag.) Gerwig is game and mostly delightful, but perhaps dominates a little too much; there's a reason why Eigeman's Nick Smith gets shunted upstate at one point (very possibly to be killed), and Damsels sometimes plays like an ensemble piece with only one role.

Damsels in Distress,2011,99,comedy,romance, , ,5238,12 fans,3.12,71,149,181,541,605,1210,1091,982,252,156," There are some people who exude effortless charm. I'm pretty convinced that Whit Stillman is not one of these people. That's not to say that he isn't charming -- his films are as quick to wrap me under their spell as an old time revival preacher -- but you can tell that he works very, very hard to make you feel this way. Perhaps this is why each of his four films deal with characters publicly and haphazardly sculpting their identities. I get the sense that Whit Stillman has been working his entire life towards creating his own character WHIT STILLMAN, and his movies are just his way of giving us a glimpse into his process. When one character in ""Damsels in Distress"" repeatedly describes a romantic foil as a ""confidence trickster"" (and what a turn of phrase!), I couldn't help but project that description onto the filmmaker himself. So what does Stillman give to us after returning from more than a decade in the wilderness? A lot more of what we'd expect from one of his films, to be sure, but with a streak of impulsiveness that leads to mixed results. If a film like ""Metropolitan"" felt like it was born fully-formed without a single hair out of place, ""Damsels in Distress"" seems a little more slapdash. As a Whit Stillman film, it is still fundamentally about the shaping of personal identity. There are still the wonderfully erudite characters and the scenes borrowed wholesale from centuries-old comedies of manners, but there are also entire scenes and subplots that fall flat despite the film investing a great deal of energy in them. The film takes place at a fictional Northeastern university, where a group of female students (led by Greta Gerwig) indoctrinate a newly transferred sophomore (Analeigh Tipton) into their bizarre clique. For Gerwig, she sees as her calling in life to help those less fortunate (read: less extraordinary) than her, usually through the power of international dance crazes and perfumed soaps. This is all ridiculous, of course, but makes a certain kind of sense in the Stillman universe. When you have already seen the barely-pubescent debutantes in ""Metropolitan"" discuss the philosophy of Charles Fourier and the films of Luis Buñuel, you just learn to accept these conceits. From there, Stillman plunges into his usual tropes of interpersonal drama among characters whose outward maturity masks the fact that they are fighting tooth and nail against actually growing up. If this sounds like a dire affair, believe me when I say that it is not. This is certainly a comedy, just a meticulously mannered one. This is the kind of movie where it's generally accepted that everyone has their own opinion on the evolution of the dandy in English literature, for example. I suppose that this is why it's so jarring to see moments when the humor feels so leaden and uncultured (the fraternity brother who doesn't know his colors? C'mon, Whit, that's just pandering). Never has Stillman's sarcasm felt this strained or overt. This is why I say that this film is much more frayed than his previous films. Perhaps it is due to the fact that he has been absent for so long, but Stillman seems to have latched onto rough ideas in this film that his previous incarnation would have refined away completely. Luckily, there's still enough of the patented Stillman charm to turn ""Damsels in Distress"" into a success. Oh, and I would be remiss if I didn't talk about Greta Gerwig. I've had my issues with the talented Ms. Gerwig in the past, mostly due to her seeming use of self-consciousness as an acting crutch, but here she is revelatory. Her acting style here is so affected that it's like seeing a completely different actress, one whom I found more delightful than in any other role that she's played. She seems to have bought in completely to the Stillman ethos, and the two are a surprisingly good match. I certainly hope that Stillman doesn't take as long to make another film, and I equally hope that in Greta Gerwig he has found his new Chris Eigeman. And seriously, if you can't delight at the sight of Greta Gerwig, of all people, having an unselfconscious, extemporaneous tap-dancing recital through the darkened corridors of academia, then I don't know if we can be friends.",5,8,0,180,815,21-Oct-12,rated-7

Having enjoyed all of his previous films it was quite pleasing to see him stick to his tried and tested formula, but whilst this belated return is a welcome one it never comes close to his best work. The film follows the fortunes and romances of a group of preppy and egotistical female college students as they attempt to impart their wisdom on those less fortunate than themselves. Bringing a new girl, Lily, into their little clique, her presence proves disruptive when a man comes between them. As with a lot of Stillman’s earlier films there isn’t really much of a plot in a traditional sense, instead the film meanders through a series of quirky and whimsical encounters that document the social etiquette of campus life. Compared to other recent indie comedies, Damsels in Distress is surprisingly bearable. It may be knowing, twee and oh so quirky but there are little gems buried throughout Stillman’s script. Perhaps the big differentiating factor is that the group aren’t supposed to be endearingly kooky but rather self-centered fools who are just as misguided as those they pretend to help. In many ways it is an overprivileged version of Heathers but without the murder. Led by indie It girl, Greta Gerwig, the group run a depression help group and relieve the misery via the power of tap dance and fragrant soap. On paper it sounds terrible but via the committed performances it proves to be quite amusing. Although less consistent that his earlier films, this latest effort still possesses a dry and acerbic wit and is filled with wonderful turns of phrase. Even when falling back on tired clichés - such as the borderline retarded frat boys - Stillman manages to push their idiocy to new and enjoyable heights. Unfortunately, for all its sporadic moments of greatness the film never really hangs together. It is so aimless and slow that, even with the sparkling and clipped dialogue, it never entertains in the way it should and by the hour mark I had lost almost all interest. Damsels in Distress is a flawed return for one of comedy’s most distinct voices. Whilst it isn’t perfect there are still flashes of Stillman brilliance, it is just a shame the overall package wasn’t more entertaining.",5,16,4,240,"14,624",15-Jun-13,rated-5

These are things I usually hate in films. Yet, I couldn't help but fall in love with Damsels in Distress. The film, like its main characters, is largely unlikable at the beginning, but as Stillman has us spend more time with them, we get to see not only what they are all about, but just how much more unlikable and operator like the other people around them are. It's largely inconsequential, and I doubt many are going to enjoy this and Stillman's largely deadpan humor, but I couldn't help but enjoy the stabs at pretentious private college life and its vacuous nature.",3,27,6,529,"3,944",13-Mar-13,rated-8

The pervasive ""minor Stillman"" impression had me assuming it was only as funny as Metropolitan without the dramatic heft. Not the case: this is Stillman's funniest. It's also the Stillman film that tries hardest to be funny. The cast—top-to-bottom excellent with Greta Gerwig, Analeigh Tipton, Megalyn Echikunwoke, Hugo Becker, Caitlin Fitzgerald, Ryan Metcalf, Adam Brody, Meredith Hagner, Billy Magnussen, and more—work tirelessly to espouse snappy one-liner after pretentious monologue after snappy one-liner, and while they don't make it look effortless they do make it look natural. The experiences of their characters aren't substantial, a familiar Stillmanesque bubble where erudite aesthetes (and dimwitted proudboys) try to will their world into a '30s romance all while dismantling it with their indiscretion and mercurialness. Nonetheless these overthinkers illustrate the folly and unavoidability of overthinking your twenties, and isn't that plus the hilarity (plus the gift of the earth-shifting international dance craze the Sambola!—""Thor can do the Sambola!"") enough? Special mention goes to Carrie MacLemore, whose work has been criminally limited to this and the Cosmopolitans pilot. She may not be as central as Gerwig or Tipton's characters, but her batting average with the repartee stands shoulder-to-shoulder. She provided my biggest laugh of the film, responding to a retelling of the myth of Sisyphus with, ""What a knucklehead.""",2,4,3,108,321,20-Jul-17,rated-8

It's a copacetic satire about what it's like to be at a private college where you're expected to conform to a set ""mold"". Greta Gerwig as the quirkier-than-Wes-Anderson lead does not want to conform. She's the kind of clueless (pun intended) mean girl (ditto) who thinks you can help suicidal people by offering them coffee and donuts and tap-dancing lessons. She also (naively, but earnestly) believes she can start an international dance craze to save America's current cultural blackhole. Given the recent race for president, can you really blame her for believing that? Here, the critics weren't right in assuming this is Whit the Wit on an off-day, or that he's somehow ""lost his touch"" because he's now so hopelessly outdated. (His new Jane Austen flick Love & Friendship seems to prove his distaste for the current time period, which I honestly can't fault him for.) This is Stillman, if not in peak peak form (he already started at the top with Metropolitan, and Last Days of Disco represented the peak), then in flippant ""down-to-my-last-fuck"" mode. The humor is derived precisely from the distanced bemusement he feels when writing situations about people throwing ""Roman holidays"" (instead of, ya know, Greek frat darties); or about sexed-up frat brahs who didn't learn their primary colors because they were ""so advanced"" they actually skipped pre-school; or about smug heads-of-newspapers who everyone swears vengeance on (the always funny and face-punchable Zach Woods, Gabe from The Office, playing a younger version of Chris Eigemen). This isn't how college students sound like, obviously. But the joke is that this is what we're always thinking. The constant thoughts of sex, the naive plucky belief that we'll change the world one iPhone at a time (High School Musical bred us to believe we're ""all in this together!""), and the closed mindedness of the world around us when we're around quirky-cutesy intellectuals for so long—these are all constants, and Stillman doesn't have to be around the millennial generation for so long that he can't see it for himself. Of course, it helps that he is generally accurate. The truly ballsy ending is both an affirmation of Jacques Demy's philosophy (i.e., dreams and naivety are an integral part of reality!) and a lightly cynical prognosis of our society as ""Meh, hopeless, but what can ya do."" I'll tell you: do the Sambola! Thor can do the Sambola!; so can you. Stillman's films are anachronisms from the moment he has edited the film in his mind—but they're more fascinating because of this habit of being perpetually late to the party. He is totally out-of-style, and by embracing this, he is in style. I far prefer this talky treatment of college, flaws and all, over the truly jockish, unsatisfactory, surprisingly clichéd Everybody Wants Some!! by Richard Linklater, who in many ways can be considered a fascinating antithesis to Whit Stillman. Damsels in Distress takes risks; EWS!! is basically what it says it is in the trailer, and not much else.",5,13,0,241,"3,258",23-Apr-16,0

His previous incisive wit has become duller, broader and, in the case of the ""What are colors?"" running gag, even really fucking dumb. Still, Gerwig has enough charm to fly this leaky boat the moon and back. And even a blunted Whit Stillman can produce a one-liner like ""Have you ever heard the expression, prevention is nine tenths the cure? Well in the case of suicide, it's ten tenths the cure."" every once and a while.  And it feels like he's opened up as a director, gotten more playful, particularly at the ending here.

(that being said, i also laughed extremely hard each time the word “operator” was used (e.g. Charlie/Fred being “a rat playboy operator”)) also also, pretty much every performance here is great, but Ryan Metcalf’s little monologue about how much of a bitch Priss was might take the cake as the funniest bit of acting in the entire film.  76/100 +, hi Meredith Hagner, you rock and you’re adorable, i hope Search Party gets picked up for another season! hey Billy Magnussen, you’re also very cute and funny, i wonder if you can do a somersault! wow, wouldya look at all these funny cuties.",6,9,0,87,"1,028",2-Jul-18,rated-8

Still frustratingly episodic, other Stillman’s aren’t know for their plot but they maintain the thematic through-line far better. The editing is rather poor, some good joke are diminished through bad timing, and the chapters and frequent fades to black are emblematic of its structural problems.  This sound like a negative review but I really do love this movie. Some have said this is the first arch Stillman, but really this is the first where reality breaks through his insular fantasy world. Real life people keep abutting the Damsels, rightfully recognizing how insane their behavior is. But as the film proves, everyone is a little crazy, and some psychosises are more productive than others.  The pursuit of virtue is, on its face, illogical. But the Christian way isn’t in pursuit of “strategic development.” It’s through finding grand meaning in the little things, like soap and bean balls. It’s in the grand Quixotic quests, like learning colors and starting international dance crazes. The Lord calls us not to be fine, but to counter our fear of failure and ridiculousness and dare to be great.

E isso agrada muita gente, e tá tudo bem (médio bem, na verdade, mas isso é outro papo), mas é precisamente o que me afasta muito dos filmes dele, não que eu ache que filmes não possam ser cínicos ou algo do tipo, é só uma questão de linguagem mesmo, não me causa muita emoção nem me mobiliza muito, e depois de alguns filmes, sequer me choca.Por que eu disse tudo isso? Bom, basicamente porque eu acho que o cinema do Stillman, as vezes, e talvez especialmente aqui, é quase uma antítese do cinismo do estilo do haneke. O investimento emocional que ele coloca nas personagens é encantador, e todas as personagens dele são simplesmente detestáveis, e ainda assim é impossível não gostar e até mesmo se projetar em algumas delas.E olhando friamente, isso aqui podia ser um filme feito só pra tirar onda e julgar patricinhas, os ""greek boys"", os suicidas e afins, mas na mão do Stillman o filme se transforma num grande processo de aprendizado e realocamento de afetos. Conhemos todos os clichês aqui, e o próprio filme versa sobre a importância dos clichês enquanto uma construção de subjetividade coletiva, e é literalmente isso o que vemos na tela. Acho que a cena mais exemplar disso é quando a personagem do Thor enxerga um arco íris e finalmente consegue nomear as cores, comovidíssimo; apesar do humor, é uma cena emotiva, uma redenção pra uma personagem que passa o filme inteiro sendo retratado como alguém tão burro mas tão burro que simplesmente não sabia o nome das cores.Na mão de um Woody Allen da vida, eu provavelmente teria me incomodado com o sem fim de piadas com suicídio, com a condescendencia interminável das personagens e mesmo com a duração de alguns monólogos, mas acho que aí entra a capacidade do diretor de criar subtextos, aí somos abençoados com diálogos do tipo: Heather: [about seventh-grade Violet] But you were nice to her?Rose: No, not really. The idea of being nice to weird and unpopular kids hadn't arrived yet. Resumindo, Stillman tem uma habilidade incrível de retratar pessoas horríveis, sem rir delas necessariamente, nem se colocar numa posição moral superior pra tecer comentários sociais, e eu sinceramente admiro isso. P.s. O Musical no final é 400 vezes melhor e mais bonito que La La Land",5,4,0,244,236,13-Nov-18,rated-8

The word had been that Whit Stillman, the writer-director behind Metropolitan, Barcelona and The Last Days of Disco would never make another movie, and yet here it was. I said then that I loved Damsels, but with reservations, and that only repeat viewings would reveal the precise depths of its myriad charms. Well here's repeat viewing #1. It starts off pretty poorly, introducing us - via naïve new pupil Analeigh Tipton - to a clique of three girls, led by the self-assured, opinionated Violet (Greta Gerwig), who run a suicide prevention centre at a college largely dominated by masculine frattery. Wobbling and hobbling through its early stages, it seems to be firing off ideas almost at random, leaving little clue as to where we're supposed to stand with any of these characters, some of whom are barely sketched in at all. Then cracks appear in the edifice and it starts to click, and for the final hour just gets better and better, proceeding to completely charm the pants off anyone who'll let it (or indeed stick with it for that long). I do think it's Stillman's weakest film by quite some distance: though the fratboy characters can be funny, they're so unrealistically stupid that they undermine the film; the misogynistic Xavier is hateful to watch, but not in any important way; and while it makes many small points, each reached through Stillman's singular, ceaselessly questioning mind, I'm not sure it has an overarching one. It is, though, illuminated by the incomparable Gerwig, speaking in that unmistakably Stillmanish way and every bit as good as she was in Greenberg and would be in Frances Ha. It's also full of memorable theories, off-kilter ideas and thoroughly unexpected delights, including a final reel that comes out of nowhere and offers some of the most immersive escapism of recent years. I can understand why people would hate it, especially if they mistake the quirks of the characters for the quirks of the writer - Stillman is sympathetic to his leads, though not blinded to their faults - but I kind of love it, aware as I am of its many failings.",5,5,0,630,"1,817",26-Jul-15,rated-8

Writer/director Dan Fogelman clearly has a lot to say here, and given his success with similar themes on the hit TV show This Is Us, it’s highly likely that the narrative of Life Itself would be better suited for a longer-form series as well. This 110-minute film simply cannot bear the weight of its unnecessarily large cast and “everything but the kitchen sink” approach to touching on nearly every form of trauma life can hurl at us. While his television show benefits from episodes upon episodes of character development and theme analysis, these beats feel far too rushed in a feature film, and we hardly gain any insight into his paper-thin protagonists as the movie liberally switches perspective far too often. To make matters worse, these pacing issues cause Fogelman’s more emotionally complex plot points to come across as repugnant and disingenuous; they feel far more like attempts at shock value given the lack of time he is able to ruminate on these topics. While the film focuses on the lineage of an American family in the first half, it abruptly transitions its focus to the tale of a Spanish household in the second half. The shift immediately feels jarring, and although this story arc is far less fanatical and sentimental, it’s simply quite a slog, and the personalities at the center of the account are bland and insubstantial. Fogelman attempts to weave his two halves into a cohesive whole at the conclusion of the film, but it comes across as far more contrived than impressive, illiciting groans rather than gasps. Technically, Life Itself leaves quite a bit to be desired as well. Aside from its vastly overwrought and overwritten screenplay (seriously, no frat boy talks the way Oscar Isaac’s Will does), the editing and music cues are tacky and strained, and the film’s unwavering dedication to voice-over continually speaks down to its audience rather than at them. I can’t say Dan Fogelman lacks ambition - he clearly put a lot of effort behind his work, despite how overblown and messy the final feature is - but Life Itself proves that his talents are best suited for the small screen. His “Big Ideas” eventually crumble beneath a film that will offend or confound many, and delight or enchant few. 2018 Ranked",6,15,4,329,"1,147",23-Sep-18,rated-3

Well if that ain't a hell of a discrepancy, I don't know what is. I've grown to recognize Rotten Tomatoes as less of a gospel towards the qualities and merits of a film and more or less a baseline towards the likelihood of enjoying a film. It's not a tool I actively use, hell Letterboxd tends to be more reliable as it acts as the crossbreed between critic and audience, but I can see the value in gauging the probability of a film working on you and as a hive of critics that one can find and analyze to find someone you for the most part consistently agree on and thus is a stand-out among the many reviewers out there (hey at least I understand it better than most people, just because a movie has a 63% score doesn't mean that's the exact score I should walk into a movie and expect). Life Itself, though, is an odd duck, as everyone's all over the map over its merits and qualities, specifically given that it comes to us through Dan Fogelman, who brought us This Is Us, which has become infamous for its sentimental melancholy (he's also brought us scripts for several Disney/Pixar films and Fred Claus, which is odd to say the least). As I try to go into films as optimistically as I can muster, I was cautious but curious. Heck, maybe some of Rotten Tomatoes' audience reviews can lift my opinion higher and get a clearer understanding of Fogelman's intent, in I'm sure the most respec-- ""A movie that only serves to prove that “critics” these days literally have their heads up their own clackers - which explains heck they miss gems like “Life Itself” while their swimming around you their butts.. "" ""I must admit that it really makes me wonder and worry about the ""professional critics"". What sort of ossified, cold and cynical heart does it take write the sort of reviews they provided. ""I'm glad I didn't check the reviews before watching this...once again, the amateurs beat the pros."" ""I wonder if the low percentage on tomatometer comes from non-Spanish speakers."" ....Fuck. It's one of THOSE movies, isn't it? Fogelman's idea of making compelling drama is to shovel a shitton of melancholic tragic tricks into a story that purports to resemble life and yet is blindly off-the-mark. Much like the end of Ray Bradbury's ""A Sound of Thunder"" where all the English signs are present, but strange and unfamiliar in its spelling, so too is everything just plainly off in its execution, in a way that is completely unsubtle and pretentious as all hell. Things really start with a shaky start with a meta-influenced first act, as Oscar Isaac takes us through his shaky relationship, his inability to notice his very pregnant wife, and his attempts at therapy in the form of scriptwriting and roping in Samuel L. Jackson for a narration (well, it's no Honey Boy, that's for sure). The first part of this intermixes its deathly serious tone and events with a unwelcome comedic sensibility coming from Isaac's asshole unsympathetic character, made worse by the continued self-satisfaction in Isaac's character's interest with his storytelling and insertion of past events (perhaps from Fogelman projecting, bad writing, who's to say?) and really out-of-place jarring humor (yes, please go on about mentioning your jerk-off fantasies to your therapist right after talking about your wife's decapitated father). None of  this is natural, is practically insulting in how it shows someone going through trauma, and ends in a way that's supposed to be a shocker but instead is just bizarre and too sudden to really elicit anything other than surprised laughter, as it sets up a tone for excessive, ineffective tragedy that stays throughout the film. Then, in Chapter 2 of these series of unfortunate events, the comedy aspects of the first chapter completely die out, essentially creating a tonal mismatch and building up immense let-down for the incomprehensible insanity that was Chapter 1. All of the other chapters, too, are the same type of dry drama that was completely unprecedented by its long-ish prolouge and essentially repeat the same thesis over and over again: tragedy's gonna happen to ya a LOT. A lot of our main characters die, cancer afflicts a major one, a old dog gets euthanized (get fucked Fogelman), everybody's goddamn sad and shit and it's all overtly mawkish and a desperate attempt to grab people's heartstrings in the hope that something relatable will pop up as an excuse for terrible writing and roundabout attempts at ""Gotcha!"" twists in its narrative (which, unsurprisingly, are half of the time predictable in the sense that it becomes a game of me guessing what the most horrible melodrama Fogelman could pull THIS time). Yeah, yeah, there's also the last hour of the movie which shifts our focus towards Spain, complete with most of the dialogue being in Spanish and it's, as you guessed it, overwrought and fruitless in its robotic attempts to be like what humans interpret as drama (am I being too mean? oh fuck it, all of this bored and infuriated the shit out of me). It's all in the film's attempts to try and prove that Life is the most unreliable narrator of all, as it constantly surprises and deceives us in ways we as feeble humans couldn't possibly comprehend (newsflash: that's only half the definition of an ""unreliable narrator""), but it is again prone to the groan-worthy cliches and melodrama one should be able to see a mile away and does so in the most surface-level, faux-deep way that really becomes aggravating in how little it has to offer besides loudly repeating in a megaphone how much of a genius it is in cracking the code by saying life's nothing but tragedy except for a sliver of hope that rests on extreme chance and happenstance that only those who can communicate in magniloquent banter will think is immensely profound. Bullshit. Life Itself is a 120-page essay on the butterfly effect that dicks around and pads itself to the required length with overused, possibly plagiarized statements in the things that makes humanity feel bad and the endless tragedies that seem to come from life in the most insiped way possible. It's a hellhole of staring deep inside the mind of a screenwriter/director who thinks he's better than you because he knows how to manipulate and entangle people into his web of soulless calamities. It is without wit, without any sense of what a creative and authentic screenplay looks like, and it has too much self-awareness in its pretentious mugging yet not self-aware to know setting yourself to be compared to Pulp Fiction is a losing fight. Life itself is nothing like this film, as it is a variety of ups and downs in life while coping pain and darkness with joy and light. To Fogelman, death is quite romantic, and his sin is his lifelessness.",15,16,8,289,662,25-Mar-20,rated-2

Life Itself is obnoxious to the point of being painful, packaging all its sequences as deep when they are in fact incredibly cheesy. It's also meta in the most annoying way, but somehow not self-aware so it still delivers its patronising message in a deadly serious manner. This is a film of endless indie tropes and quirks, centred around a recurring sequence of someone getting hit by a bus (which just, y'know, *sigh*, is such a misjudged premise). The first half of Life Itself follows an incredibly irritating character played by Oscar Isaac. Now his character has legitimate trauma and troubles, so his actions induce some sympathy, but the film tries to be funny. Like, it makes lighthearted jokes about Natalie Portman during a section on child molestation and decapitated parents. I have no problem with really dark comedy, but Life Itself tries so hard to be dramatic at the same time. It's so tonally misjudged in how it tackles this very serious subject matter, which is all the more bizarre because the comedy stops after the first act. There's something that feels incredibly wrong about all this. I felt the first half of Life Itself would be the peak of its terribleness, then the whole plot relocates to Spain for the second half and just becomes really dull. At one point Antonio Banderas gives a five minute speech that goes absolutely nowhere. Life Itself also takes the time to exoticise Spain, showing the country as a land of simple people living traditional lifestyles, people so foreign that they can spend months in America and still never hear of concepts like veganism or April's Fools. I would get more angry but this whole section was so boring I could have died watching it and not realised. Early on the film, there's a discussion on the brilliance of Bob Dylan. As proof of his artistic genius, a character cites the Grammys that he won (LOL). It seems even when genius is blatantly obvious Life Itself misses the point. There's a repeated thesis in Life Itself, which I'll paraphrase as ""all narrators are unreliable ... so the only reliable narrator is life itself ... which is itself unreliable due to its unpredictability"". This is not a deep concept, in fact it's pretty obvious. Imagine basing an entire film about this concept and thinking you're a genius (characters literally talk about how clever this thesis is - holy crap this is an arrogant film). Considering Rashomon basically covers all of this I don't understand how anyone in 2018 could think they've made a smart film by dumbing down the concept and having Oscar Isaac make masturbation jokes whilst discussing his dead wife with a therapist. Life Itself spans at least three or four generations of a family, covering decades of time (including at least 50 years after the bus incident). But all the production design, dialogue, and costumes are contemporary. Nothing changes in style, even when scenes jump to decades before or after. This feels antithetical to the thesis that life is unpredictable (unless of course the world never changing is itself unpredictable but LOL the film isn't that deep). Stuff like this is just baffling, did no one question these decisions when making the film? Life Itself is a film where every character is annoying. It's exploitative, manipulative garbage about how great life is in spite of its tragedies. I ate half a litre of vegan caramel ice cream whilst watching Life Itself and it was still less sickly than the disgusting mess onscreen. The endless platitudes made me want to puke up everything I'd eaten. Characters can monologue all they want about finding the love song amongst the melancholia, I'm still going to tell them to fuck off with their bullshit clichés. The only thing life-affirming about this piece of crap is that surviving to the end feels like a miracle. 2018 Ranked",7,34,6,748,"7,954",9-Feb-19,rated-2

This glib, meta treatment of Paul Haggis' Crash brought to us by the screenwriter of Cars is tonally stupid. Starting off aggressively obnoxious, every character played by this mostly A-list cast (Annette Bening, Oscar Isaac, Olivia Cooke, Olivia Wilde) seems to be a different facet of the same depressed 40 year old hipster. It's ridiculously saccharine at times, trying desperately not to come off as pretentious and failing. At the halfway mark it turns on a dime from a coy exploration of mortality to a Spanish melodrama. There's a method to the madness however because all of the contrived emotional whiplash is there to provoke a nice Hallmark channel cry, but it's hard to muster up any tears when you're too busy rolling your eyes.

I'll admit though, some scenes are pretty effective, especially in the second half, with the more decent performances really pulling their fair share and then some. The narrative structure is just insane though. Fogelman is an experienced screenwriter so I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the first half of this film is a tonal nightmare and I'm struggling to think of any recent film that completely disregards the 17-minute rule* with such reckless abandon. It's almost admirable how boldly this film swings and misses. *Film School Corner: the 17-minute rule is a screenwriting guideline that basically says the first act should end right around the 17-minute mark. From Marvel blockbusters to foreign art house cinema, most films have the inciting incident that ends the first act (and kicks off the second act) right around the 17-minute mark.

If you are going to use “Chapters”, may I suggest keeping to only 3? Chapters 4 and 5 felt rushed, and I strongly suggest following the 3 Act Structure as we learned this semester.  CHARACTERS: 1/5.    Unfortunately I did not connect with these characters in the way you intended. In fact, I didn’t find any of them likeable at all. I was particularly disturbed by Will, who came off as an arrogant misogynist. At times, the line between budding romance and unhealthy obsession were too blurred for my taste. On the same note, I felt the women were either underwritten to say the least. I suggest you share your screenplay with a fellow, female class mate and see how she feels about these women. I also can’t help but notice that, sans Will’s suicide, everyone who dies in this film is a woman. Why is that?  DIALOGUE: 2/5     There were strong moments, and I’m impressed with your Spanish! I know you mentioned your study abroad in Madrid, and the Spanish 201 classes are really showing in this work! However I felt the characters were often times repeating themselves and saying things that people wouldn’t say in day-to-day conversation. Try reading some of these scenes out loud and see if it comes off naturally or not. PLOT: 1/5    This is difficult to evaluate since seemingly nothing happens, and perhaps that’s your point? It seems the only plot points of this screenplay was when a (female) character dies tragically. Is that really “Life Itself”? Also, I’ll remind you that not every love story has to start with a meet cute! USE OF THE SAME SONG OVER AND OVER: 5/5     You nailed this! Excellent work.  OVERALL GRADE: 55/100.    Mr. Fogelman, it disappoints me to give you this grade. I was looking forward to this screenplay and I felt like you’ve given me a first draft. I think you have the potential to be a wonderful writer, but you need to start believing and caring that you are! A few small suggestions I’d like to share: watch more films. As evident by the screenplay, you’ve taken to heart our recommended viewing list but there is more to life than Quentin Tarantino! Watch your swears! The use of the “F” word is the mark of a frustrated writer, trying to punch up a script. You’re far better than that. Also beware of your exposition - it’s not cute to be on the nose.     I strongly suggest you take another look at your screenplay and perhaps share it with your peers for their feedback. I hope you continue writing and I encourage you to be more critical of your own work. I’d love to read the second draft of this. Despite this grade, I’d still recommend you for my Screenwriting 102 class. Have a wonderful summer",6,44,3,81,780,23-Sep-18,rated-1

I really was into the first half, but the film just stalls once the third of the four chapters of the film begins and completely switches the main characters (something the film does quite often).

The impressionistic and significant themes that Gance had employed on earlier films, such as with his 1924 film La Roue, foreshadowed many of the techniques utilised to their maximum effect here to establish a cinema experience that was unequalled in its day and remains impressive; with its split-screen vitality, furious cutting, powerful close-ups and much more. Gance clearly supported the view that the camera should be emancipated from being an anchored piece of equipment so that audiences could transcend just solely being passive observers, and by the manipulation of the many techniques within the film he anticipated the spectators to bound along with the narrative as it unspools in front of them. None of what's accomplished here would likely have been undertaken so passionately if Gance did not have such an enthusiastic investment in its subject, and this resulting five-and-a-half-hour masterpiece is a breathtaking milestone in film history.",2,50,4,"6,764","12,333",8-May-20,rated-10

Though I suppose the terrible haircut humanizes him a bit. The filmmaking is very impressive, but, unsurprisingly for a film that's so long, the plot really drags at times. The section that focuses on Josephine feels completely frivolous and interminable and I still have no idea who the woman with the Napoleon shrine is supposed to be or why she's in the film. There's also a lot of focus on Robespierre and the other leaders of the Revolution that's historically important but feels a bit tangential to Napoleon's story.

And a really funny one too; I was surprised by how much humour there is in the film, and not just in act three, but all the way through here and there. I think seeing it with an audience will really have helped bring out the comedic side to the film - often the way.  I suppose one of the things you can do if you give yourself the best part of six hours to play with is explore a variety of moods and genres, and that Gance knits them all together so seamlessly is a great achievement.  A truly sweeping historical film, it got better and better for me as it went along, and it begins with an amazing choice of opening scene (young Napoleon engaged in a mass snowball fight, a fun and energetic way to prefigure his leadership qualities), before moving through several really brutal battle scenes amongst other things (the scale of the production regularly eye-widening), winding up at the famous triptych ending in Italy which is extremely effective in its clever multiple uses as well as obviously technically some kind of visionary manoeuvre. It felt to me pleasingly like an antecedent of Xavier Dolan pulling the frame apart in MOMMY.  It's great, and typifies Gance's inventive approach to form throughout, his film featuring compositions of depth and detail, everything from extreme close-ups (Napoleon's haloed delivery of certain speeches are transcendent) to shots stood back so far that the number of people he jams into the tiny frame seems impossible. He overlays image on top of image to suit a wide variety of intentions; I especially enjoyed the various images of Napoleon riding majestically through 'His Country', as the inter title has it! There were a lot of inter titles for a silent film, many apparently drawn from true historical testimony, and they were brilliantly spaced and worded and not infrequently poetically moving, when they weren't nudging you at just the right time to make you chuckle. The Philharmonia Orchestra were absolutely phenomenal playing the live Carl Davis score. I especially loved the First Violinist's superb soloing over various scenes, including the Eat The Document sequence which was one of the funniest and weirdest moments in the movie. I wonder if I'm more impressed due to being a total non-musician, but I am always just in awe of what these people do. I'd rather have seen a print, of course, but I get the impression (and I know nothing of the various cuts, and their history) that this latest BFI/Kevin Brownlow restoration was probably the ultimate version of the film to see, so I guess I'm pretty lucky. It was amazing, either way. An astonishing film that seems to contain pretty much everything one could want out of cinema. It even holds great contemporary sociopolitical relevance - the moment at which Napoleon idealistically declares his dream of the day that Europe will unite as a 'single common people' got the biggest cheer from seemingly everyone inside the Royal Festival Hall.

Griffith laid the foundations of the cinematic language in the early years of the silent era, Abel Gance built a gargantuan skyscraper on them at its close with Napoléon, or Napoléon as seen by Abel Gance as the on-screen title will proudly display. A staggering achievement in spectacle, vision and hubris, this first in a planned (but sadly failed) series of six biopics on the life of France's most famous son details his early years in school, adventures in his home of Corsica, his role in the revolution and continual rise through the military ranks. Stretching over five and a half hours, the word epic isn't superlative enough to describe the experience of viewing this extraordinary piece of work. I'd read beforehand that it had gained a reputation and recognition for its innovation in terms of editing and cinematographic techniques but nothing prepares you for the tour de force that follows; a dazzling display of visual trickery that beats you so hard into submission to the extent that you can only sit there and gawp, slack-jawed at Gance's outrageous conceit and mad genius. Not content to follow the conventional route of static camera setups common in silent film, he straps it to every conceivable surface including horseback, moving platforms, vehicles, pendulums and even the cameramen themselves. The creativity doesn't stop there however. Montage is used in ways that had never been done before and probably never again since, in addition to (courtesy of wikipedia) hand-held camera shots, location shooting, point of view shots, multiple-camera setups, multiple exposure, superimposition, underwater camera, kaleidoscopic images, film tinting, split screen, mosaic shots and multi-screen projection. The hand-held shots in particular are just wild experimentation, not something that you expect in classic cinema and absolutely not from the silent era, in this aspect Gance seems to bring the past into the future using this purely visual art to its fullest potential. The sheer spectacle is unprecedented and hasn't been equalled since because it simply isn't possible to do so. The film does have its critics and perhaps rightly so, the length is utterly exhausting, the techniques used wildly haphazard and the ideology imbued into this dramatic portrayal of a historical figure is questionable, though none of this even crosses your mind once that opening snowball fight ensues, nor does it right up until that triptych finale where the three colours of the French flag are displayed across the widest aspect ratio ever used in cinema history (4.00:1). The restoration of this project is the culmination of several decades of painstaking work by the likes of Kevin Brownlow, Francis Ford Coppola and Carl Davis, whose score for this version is outstanding, making use of a full orchestra and even seeking out a hurdy-gurdy player for a scene that features one, it does infinitely more to enhance the imagery than a simple piano accompaniment could ever do. I was expecting to merely appreciate this film for its technical achievements, but the grandeur and scope of Gance's immersive vision completely swept me off my feet emotionally too. Every victory, every heart pounding brush with fate and every flashback was shared like a spiritual experience. If you can find the time to sit down and watch it I'm sure you'll agree this is truly something special.",8,24,4,643,"1,234",5-Aug-18,rated-10

W. Griffith's Intolerance.  Prior to having seen Napoleon, I had already experienced once Abel Gance through The Wheel although I was still unready for what I was set to experience again. Reportedly it was only the first of what was supposed to be a series of five films covering Napoleon and if it were the case, then such a journey would only be heavenly to all degrees from what I can only imagine. Even trying to write about something so ahead of its own time is already a difficult challenge in itself, but ultimately only the best shows and it was unbelievably rewarding. Abel Gance's silent epic covers various facets of Napoleon's life, going from his childhood to his own romances, not forgetting his significant role within the French Revolution. Yet it is never really as simple as covering Napoleon's life where Abel Gance has managed to score such a grand triumph on the spot. Although telling the story of its own subject is one of the most important things to carry when covering the life of a figure much like Napoleon, Abel Gance has achieved something so out of the ordinary not only for his own time when he created Napoleon. Like the very best of biopics, there's a great sense of character that finds itself acquired from how it studies what has formed Napoleon's personality during the most important moments of his own life, but it's how we are being told this story that makes the film stand out so easily. To think of how much did D. W. Griffith accomplish with his 1916 epic Intolerance around three hours, Abel Gance goes even further by telling a single story spanning for near five hours in length. It is one amongst the most intimidating aspects of Napoleon but at one watches how Gance still plays a sort of subversion when it comes to what sort of an experiment is being performed on the spot. The story of Napoleon himself is split into differing segments of his own life but there's always a sense of fluidity present that ever manages to keep a consistent flow, allowing for such an intimidating running time to feel much shorter within experience. Gance assembles tidbits of the life of Napoleon onto the screen to form a different sort of experience that proves itself rewarding for what it achieves on the spot goes far beyond its own time. In part it could very well be a myth but the craft is unlike anything else out there. Every act of Napoleon finds itself dedicated to a different portion of Napoleon's life yet the fact that it comes out as a perfect setup for what is set to come else within his own life is something clever on the inside. In part it can easily be seen as a myth for there may not be so much a clear idea of Napoleon during childhood although looking upon how everything adds up to the very next moment in time and what comes forth is nothing more than only some of the finest examples of storytelling committed to a screen of any size. But what's most remarkable about how Napoleon details such moments of the figure's life is how even though a segment may feel so different in tone from the past, there is always a perfect flow and blend as a result of the editing techniques coming into play - which still stand out today. But the cohesive nature all keeps a single character's growth intact - arguably the most important facet of exploring a character like Napoleon. Amongst many of the most impressive technical achievements that were ever present in Napoleon comes the use of split screen. While there were many fast-paced edits coming then and there especially in small sequences like a snowball fight (filmed in a manner that it looks like fighting on a battlefield, hinting only at Napoleon's future from there), Gance has also achieved a visual style no other director has ever been able to match. If yet there were another thing about Napoleon coming to mind, it would be how Gance manages to give Napoleon his own presence on the screen - creating only such an insane sort of style that could never be matched again. Abel Gance's techniques still remain as fascinating now as they ever were so back in its day. I could probably write much more but it would be far too difficult of a task to uncover because everything about Napoleon finds itself flowing so perfectly on all grounds and it just blew my mind that something of this sort was made back in 1927. But even to think about how this was actually only one of what was supposed to be a saga of six films that would overall span over 30 hours, all that I could ever have imagined that if Abel Gance ever completed his vision, something godly were to be laid upon the screen on all counts. I'm not even sure how something of this sort could have ever been made the way that it was back in 1927, but alongside its technical achievements the psychological case study that it exhibits through how it explores Napoleon's life is something of another kind. One of the greatest achievements to be committed to the screen, I'm not even fairly sure this is all human.",6,71,7,"1,347","6,791",11-Feb-17,rated-10

It is a grand crescendo of art and life. Everything about it is incredible as an achievement. It is a silent film of such epic proportions that you feel the weight of history, but it also has a personal intimacy that allows the film to meander on a romance for an hour. It is a wonder to behold, turning chaos into art and producing a film of emotion as well as a stunning technical showcase. Napoleon is heavy on foreshadowing. It is the depiction of a singular man, but every moment feels like it was destined. Napoleon is depicted a man who sought destiny, dreaming to restore liberty to his land and bring revolution to Europe. He was going to liberate a continent. However, whilst Napoleon is comprehensive, it is incomplete. There was meant to be many sequels to this, so the film ends early in Napoleon's life, despite the five hour runtime. Yet what we do get is a cry for revolution. Napoleon depicts a fight for the soul of France. The French Revolution remains, alongside both World Wars, the most significant event of modern Western history. Within Napoleon, France is shown in a state of terror, with the world upturned, and the dirty and the poor given the joy of watching heads roll. The shadow of the guillotine is one of the film's most powerful images. This is a tale of class, as the idle rich look down on Napoleon and his Corsican heritage stands against him. He has to carry the spirits of the revolution with him, to enshrine its legacy. He is a God, depicted with a light shining behind him, as he inspires and converts everyone he meets. Napoleon brings history alive like few films ever manage. History clashes together through insignificant coincidences, and destiny propels Napoleon Bonaparte through each these events as he rides each wave of historical immortality. This is a film with a red-tinged battle under rainfall. Ghosts of men wander through history and it is stormy fights of desperation like this that have brought us to our present day. Right from the opening fight of Napoleon, it is clear that this is a masterclass of scale and fluidity in filmmaking. It contains the most impressive of all silent era cinematography. How were they able to achieve such scale and beauty with such limited technical resources? This is film of images you will never forget, like Napoleon riding horseback chased by an army, crowds of a hundred men fighting under smoke lit by flashes of light, and the magnificent evocative silhouettes that litter the runtime. Images are overlayed and the screen is split, this is a truly innovate film that is so sophisticated in technique and the most modern of all silent cinema. It has everything besides sound, even crude animation and a small dose of slapstick humour. The score is also amazing, with loud, epic sweeps of classical music. The film's most amazing moment comes in the singing of the anthem, La Marseillaise. Through the tears of a hundred faces and a perfect feeling of expectation and spontaneity, we feel as if those on screen are singing to us. If silent film could achieve that, what couldn't be accomplished? The second half of Napoleon does not equal the first, as it gets caught in a couple of tangents. But then the incredible finale is a magnificent end to this journey. Napoleon contains many astonishing battle sequences, but the infamous triptych final battle, in the super widescreen 4.00:1 ratio, is jaw-dropping. It has a remarkable effect, creating a splintered world on an incomprehensible scale. It is moving, hypnotic, complicated, beautiful, and staggering. This is a montage dedicated to France, culminating in a final triptych in the colours of the French flag. Revolution, genius, and luck had brought Napoleon to this moment. His fate would change the world forever. On the journey of this film the world unites to go down a path of solidarity. Crass it may be, but just this once, Vive la France!",4,45,4,748,"7,954",2-Jun-20,rated-9

I say ""was"" because apparently he come to love it. And maybe because of this or something else he was drawn to write and direct his own version based on Napoleon. Sadly he died before he could accomplish this, and so far no Spielberg or anyone has dared to pull an AI. Truth be told, from a filmmaking perspective, Abe has archived something that puts him in the same pedestal as many of the groundbreaking filmmakers that changed the way we see cinema. You just have to look at the iconic third act where he attempts to pull a cinemascope before Hollywood or anyone had a damn idea what was that. The use of color to represent the flag and the value of France was brilliant. Some of the acting and staging work was superb. Robespierre swag with those glasses is the coolest thing ever. Unfortunately the movie always feels less like a narrative and more like a series of visual bullet points. You get to learn some things, but I was personally never that entertained and really it drags a lot. I get they were trying to capture many of the story of Napoleon, and maybe for a talkie or a miniseries this would be phenomenal, but a silent 5hrs+ is almost an excruciating watch. All in all, if you are seriously into films and consider yourself a diehard cinephile, then maybe I guess this is mandatory watch, otherwise you may very well skip it or just watch some clips on Youtube.",4,23,4,"1,304","1,247",2/6/20,rated-5

C’est comme s’il avait évolué au-delà du dialogue parlé en une hallucination muette colossale. C’est une œuvre tout simplement incroyable, sa pure ambition, son panache et son adresse passionnée au public sont extraordinaires. La caméra de Gance, comme l'aigle de Napoléon, pique et plane et confronte son sujet, et le film se termine enfin par son triptyque panoramique à trois caméras incroyablement audacieux du champ de bataille sur le site de la campagne italienne triomphante de Napoléon, parfois des scènes imbriquées, parfois des images en écran partagé, parfois des panneaux symétriques en miroir, le tout culminant dans une rhapsodie tricolore en rouge, blanc et bleu. Ses images intimement mystérieuses et ses magnifiques décors sont plus fascinants que jamais. Le film raconte la vie de Napoléon Bonaparte, le Corse qui adopte la France comme patrie, monte au rang de général suprême des armées françaises pendant la Révolution et s'empare finalement du siège du gouvernement lui-même. Aussi impressionnant que cela puisse paraître, il a été conçu comme une biographie en six parties qui retrace la vie de Napoléon de l'enfance à la fin amère à Sainte-Hélène. Cela commence par un long examen de l'enfance de Napoléon dans une école catholique. Les combats de boules de neige entre Napoléon et deux futurs ennemis laissent présager l'avenir. L'amitié de Napoléon avec un aigle de compagnie préfigure son rôle d'empereur de France. Mais même si ces scènes représentent plus de licence artistique que d'histoire, elles sont extrêmement bien jouées par le jeune Vladimir Roudenko.  Parmi les nombreuses innovations, il y a des jeux d'acteurs relativement naturalistes des membres de la distribution et des séquences de montage à couper le souffle, en particulier pendant la bagarre de boules de neige et la bagarre dans les dortoirs. Une utilisation si innovante du montage ne serait probablement pas vue avant 30 ou 40 ans.  Après une heure de cette épopée, nous sommes transportés à la période de Napoléon adulte, joué avec gravité et glace par Albert Dieudonné. Le film s'attarde beaucoup sur la période de formation où Napoléon arrive pour la première fois à Paris à la fin de la Révolution, en se concentrant fortement sur la façon dont le chaos de la ville a imprégné à Napoléon l'autoritarisme et les traits de leadership dictatoriaux qui émergeraient plus tard dans sa vie. C'est peut-être le point culminant du film. Le montage et les images visuelles créent un effet tourbillonnant, tournoyant et époustouflant extrêmement efficace. Le film se concentre ensuite sur le retour de Napoléon en Corse, dont les gens avaient des allégeances à l'Espagne et à l'Italie ainsi qu'à la France, et où Napoléon a été emprisonné en raison de ses penchants français. Pour tous ceux qui souhaitent en savoir plus sur la vie de Napoléon, ce segment est assez révélateur. Il est suivi d'une séquence incroyablement efficace qui transmet la puissance et la terreur d'une tempête en mer. La dernière heure et demie du film dépeint la montée de Napoléon dans l'armée et son mandat d'empereur de France. C'est peut-être la partie du film que la plupart des téléspectateurs considéreraient comme l'histoire meme Napoléon. Mais peut-être l'une des raisons pour lesquelles ce film est si fascinant est qu'il plonge profondément dans les épisodes formatifs de la première vie de Napoléon et leur donne autant d'importance qu'à ses actions ultérieures sur le champ de bataille en Italie, à son mandat d'empereur et à son exil, retour et exil ultérieurs.  Alors que ce film colossal se termine, nous n’en sommes encore qu’au stade du premier commandement de Napoléon: Austerlitz, Borodino et Waterloo sont toujours dans le futur.  Napoléon est bien plus qu'un simple personnage principal. C'est un excellent portrait, et parfois brillant, d'une époque tumultueuse qui affecte encore le monde. Sans toujours adhérer strictement à l'histoire, il décrit assez fidèlement l'atmosphère générale de l'époque, montrant que la carrière de Napoléon Bonaparte a été créée en partie par la situation qui l'entoure. Napoléon est l’un des plus grands chef-d’œuvres de l’histoire de la réalisation cinématographique et de l’histoire du cinéma et de l’art en général, c’est une réussite à tout les niveaux a des années lumières de son époque.",12,14,8,283,226,4-Nov-20,rated-10

By focusing on one of the most important characters of the last decade of 18th century it is also a precise historical report of a tense and utterly significant period in Europe’s history.  Napoleon is a film of small details and numerous characters (almost all of them historical figures) and it is through this ultra-vivid structure that it finally succeeds in portraying a three dimensional and lively character who was driven by high ambitions. The film starts by showing us Napoleon’s childhood and from the opening moments it pictures a man who is determined to change the world around himself and turn it into something that he dreams of, it is not hard to understand that his patriotism and courage make him the right person to lead a nation into pride and glory. What makes the film even more exciting is that it is not only about Napoleon, but like real life the film sees him as a character in the middle of the turmoil and instability of French revolution and not just a hero living in vacuum, the fact that his story runs parallel to the story of French Revolution allows the film to give a better understanding of the circumstances which led to Bonaparte’s rise to power. Napoleon is a fascinating biopic about one of the most influential figures in the history of Europe – and the world of course, the only problems I had with the film were that A)its second half is not as inspiring and as fabulous as its first half and B) the love affair between Napoleon and Josephine lacks the warmth and strength that you expect from an epic, but despite these two minor issues it is a very delicate and exciting biopic which features some of the most eye-catching editing techniques in silent cinema and with its various characters and relaxed pace it will remind you of the kind of glory that is only achievable in literary works.

French Revolution movies are few and far between these days, save for the occasional adaptation of LES MISÉRABLES, and I'm not sure why. This period of history is very interesting and kind of insane.

And maybe the definition of a biopic epic. With a runtime of 5 1/2hours this is monumental for 1927. I mean what a movie year. Oscar winner Wings is a fantastic monumental war story and even better this Napoleon biopic is but what’s also made in the same year is Lang’s Metropolis. I would say 1927 is the beginning of the greatest movie years of all time followed by 1957/94 etc. but for the handful films which were 1927 directed it’s really incredible.  So to the movie itself all I could say is that’s a ride. A silent movie ride like I’ve never seen before than in metropolis. Great actors behind the maybe greatest biopic story ever and a masterful really masterful direction. The cinematography for 1927 is out of the world. French German production of the camera makes this so incredible. Some background color shots remind me of kurosawas kagemusha but even more epic and I mean that was one of  kurosawas greatest cinematographies. Also the Black and white shots reminds me of a seven samurai especially in battle scenes. My most favorite shot here which is truly masterful is the eagle which gets into one with Napoleon. Really the epic of a scene.  Than the score which is made originally by Honegger but added to that it was completed by carmine Coppola and Carl Davis for more than a suitable and epic background. Feels like a mixup of Beethoven and Wagner. Absolute epic. I never imagine how they bring this massive of people on a screen in 1927 with such a great direction of glance. Napoleon is great portrayed and the fact that they want to bring out five more movies of his story makes me sad that they also haven’t the financials to make them like Kubrick later. Hell I would give everything to see kubricks version of this epic. That would have been potential for the greatest movie of all time. Barry Lyndon was just a look to what he could have made. Sad just sad he also hadn’t the financials for it.  At all pure greatness. A recommend for everyone who enjoys massive war epics and a great biopic. It only has one issue that the runtime is too long for a silent film but what you get on screen will you make forget about it. Alone the ending where the screen is splittet into three screens which changing with the eagle in the end into the French colors. One of the greatest moments in film.  For liking this more than the human condition part 3 I decide both deserves the highest of a score. Truly two of the greatest war dramas ever. More than worth the hours. Just my eight 5⭐️Rating on first seen movies on Letterboxd but my third this month. What’s going on.

Told in 4 acts, the film tells the true story of Napoleon Bonparte, the mighty warrior that lead the French revolution from when he was a child to he's rise, up and downs and evensure rise to victory.There is no better word to describe Napoleon then breath taking. It is a incredibly breath taking film especially for it's time in the 1920s. 1927 was a great year for film ain't it? Metropolis, Wings, Sunrise, Hitchcock's The Lodger, the first sound film ever The Jazz Singer (albeit not a great film but it's still significant) and finally theres Napoleon. What a film it is, just wow. For a 5 hour long silent film its surpisingly well paced and action packed more then you might expect, it's a pretty entertaining film considering its length and time period. First theres the performance, a lot of the actors does a fine job for what kind of role they were givin' but undoubtedly its Albert Dieudonne portrayal of Napoleon that carries the film and is truly special. Every minute this guy is on screen his presence, energy, passion and the need in his eyes make you believe with no doubt he is Napoleon. A wonderful performance that effectively bring Napoleon to life, I also want to mention Vladimir Roudenko who played the younger version of Napoleon who does a great job giving the viewers the sense that he is the younger Napoleon and whenever he has to show his emotions it feels really real which is impressive for a young actor in the 1920s to do but the segment you all are probably waiting for is the direction and I can't blame you. The word film cannot be used here with Abel Gance's direction, it's truly a moving picture of delight and grandiose, in all 4 acts there will be atleast 2 moments that would give me chills down my back, that's how amazing the direction is. The framings, blockings and camera movements are always articulate and stunning not only because of how he uses what's in the frame but what's in it, the amount of extras, battles and wideness to the screen is so just god damn epic. The color tint throughout also add a lot to the film as well and of course I can't go on without mentioning the famous 3 screen climax. You see back in the 1920s widescreens didn't exist yet, heck even Cinerama isn't around until a few decades after and so the concept of a film being wider is quite the novelty at the time and although yes the climax is quite dated now with a lot of the mistakes being really noticable but the impact of it still remains, just seeing the 4 by 3 screen widens into that ultra widescreen is still such a awe to the witness. If there is one flaw here its mostly Act 3. The first 2 acts run at a steady pace, keeping the drama and action nicely balanced while going through the story and overall those 2 acts were really enjoyable until we get to Act 3 where the weight of the film collapsed. With it being the longest act out of the 4 acts, running nearly at 3 hours it sure was a chore to sit through, the romance, melodrama and studden break in the fast pace kinda puts me off of it. It's not bad in fact by the end I was kinda getting used to it but overall that act just serves the story without giving the fun like the last 2 acts did. Again not bad just really dull and uninteresting, how it shifts just feels too rushed and it just didn't work for me but thankfully act 4 came and save the day with its epic battle montage, the 3 screen climax and the score which I have to mention as well. Depending on the version you seen, I watched the BFI 2016 release which includes a 7.1 surround sound soundtrack from famous composer Carl Davis who's score captures the size and scope of the film brilliantly and although most of the score is generic there are some melodies here and there (like Napoleon's theme song heard throughout the film) that really stuck with you after it's over. If you are planning to watch Napoleon definitely watch the BFI release. Napoleon is just as amazing as it sounds. Yes Act 3 drags but ultimately the great over came the bad on this one, the direction is solid, the actor playing Napoleon is great, the score by Carl Davis is bombastic and overall the story is pretty entertaining and if you are someone with some tastes am sure you might enjoy Act 3 more then me. Overall Napoleon is a stunning epic film, am sure it's not 100% accurate to the true story but who cares because even if it's not 100% true to real life it's definitely 100% extraordinary. Its innovative and a head of its time, its exciting and adventurous but mostly importantly it's just a damn fine film. If you got 6 hours in your hands, a good to great surround sound system and a love for silent films or epic movies then Napoleon is a must to experience.",1,5,0,68,106,27-Oct-20,rated-10

It was a paean to the military genius and liberator from Corsica, and it only became known as Eroica (as opposed to simply being named for Napoleon) in the wake of Napoleon's turn toward true imperialism after becoming officially the Emperor of France. Others alive at the time (and later, of course), viewed him as a tyrant, a villain. Before Hitler became a byword for evil, many Europeans used ""Napoleon"" as the point of comparison for all the evil of humanity. The truth of the matter is, as ever, in between the two, I am sure, but this film doesn't have time for that. The entirety of its five hour run is devoted entirely to the Napoleon of Beethoven's third symphony. This is a mythologizing of Napoleon's origins and rise to power. That it is incomplete, that it was intended to be a 30 hour serialized biopic, suggests that perhaps Gance intended to delve into other facets of Napoleon, but by all appearances, it was going to be a glowing canonization. In order to convey the greatness Gance apparently saw in Napoleon, he used every filmic trick in the book. The famed triptych photography is only a part of it. Like Eisenstein with Ivan the Terrible, Gance used shadow and positioning to give Napoleon a presence on screen. The translucent imagery often employed to show thought and ghosts comes into play several times, and the depiction of Napoleon's study of a map seems like a precursor to the Sherlock scan or the empathy routine used in Hannibal for Will Graham. It's a visualization of an impossible thought process, using special effects, to make a character seem notably more intelligent and capable, and it was surprising and delightful to find it here, 80 years before either of those shows copped it from a dozen others before. I understand this is a re-edit from a noted historian, and that it was scored by those he worked with. They deserve a great deal of respect for their work here, creating a score that emphasizes the scale and scope of this movie. I must say, I've always felt the American national anthem was somewhat lacking. Compared to La Marseillaise, it might as well be a bad sitcom theme song or something. That is what national anthems should sound like. But I digress. I wanted to focus on certain moments in the film that make this more a myth than a biopic. The first is the early scene where Napoleon's eagle returns to him after he is punished for fighting those who set it free. It sets the tone early, and while the symbolism of comparing Napoleon to an eagle is pretty heavy handed, was fairly effective at getting me stirred up. The most over-the-top moment was, of course, Napoleon stopping in the hall where the ghosts of the revolution speak to him, urging him to conquer Europe and bring his ideals to the whole world. It's an amazing moment of fantasy storytelling that I wish would have been stolen for a few great wizard-and-dragon epics. I might steal it myself. The worst part about this film, of course, is its incompleteness. This would be less galling were there not several tantalizing hints of what was to come, including a young Napoleon being taught about the island of St. Helene and a chance non-encounter with a British navalman named Nelson. I'd happily sit through 30 hours of this ridiculous, sprawling, worshipful storytelling.",5,65,0,792,"13,950",22-Mar-14,0

There's a lot to say from this monster of a film, but I won't say much cause it won't probably do the film justice. It's mostly impressive. Gance probably revolutionized the medium; using it to do things no one would have dare or thought. It's crazy to think that this film is from 1927 when you consider the scale of it whether it be the battles, those scenes with so many extras or just its crazy length. If I was to rate Napoléon solely based on its technical aspects and legacy, it would be an easy five. Yet, I feel I can't rate such a film. I felt so distant from it in so many ways. I can't really explain in what ways or why, but I just can't seem to rate it. There are things to enjoy and appreciate about this one for sure; I was a big fan of how Gance used the screen at the end, brillant. Still, I would be lying if I said it wasn't long and painful by moment. I just think that a rating reflecting my enjoyment of the film wouldn't be appropriate and wouldn't actually say much about the film itself.",2,8,0,104,379,30-Jan-19,0

I haven't seen this for quite a few years but today (all day) I watched this unique film on the big screen, in the 5 and a half hour Photoplay restoration with score conducted live by Carl Davis with the Philharmonia Orchestra. The story of how Kevin Brownlow has spent nearly half a century working on restoring this film to as close to Abel Gance's original vision as possible is well known - and this version, assembled in 2000 and now having a well-deserved theatrical renaissance, is possibly the last word on how the film should be presented. Abel Gance had previously directed the epic 'J'accuse' and for the subject of Napoleon Bonaparte originally planned six linked films, but after the poor critical reception to this first segment (taking Napoleon from boyhood to conquest of Italy) the plan stalled, the film was cut, and the original idea and footage was thought lost. Thanks to Photoplay - and Carl Davis' score - we can see that Gance's film (although not without its faults, including a rather stodgy mid-section concerning Napoleon's courtship of Josephine) is a really unique experience.   It has filmic tricks years ahead of their time (overlays, reflections, lighting, and the famous triptych which prefigures wide-screen projection by three decades), and despite the occasional ripe performance, has a towering central figure of authority in Albert Dieudonne as Napoleon,  while Vladimir Roudenko is impressive as the boy who grows to become the great General. From the snowball and pillow fights of Napoleon's boyhood school, to the siege of Toulon, the French Revolution, and the invasion of Italy, this film is constantly stunning and surprising.  And those final twenty minutes of triple screen bliss, eventually becoming the colours of the French flag, are the last word in patriotism. Gance never had another success in the cinema, and in fact several reference books from the 1960s and 1970s seem to assume he died young when in fact he was still alive to witness when Brownlow's first restoration was shown in 1979.  Perhaps this was the only great work he had in him. Whatever the truth, Napoleon is a great achievement, and its flaws are outweighted by a vast collection of pluses.  It also packs a large emotional punch towards the end.  Superb cinema.",9,47,1,556,"2,467",30-Nov-13,rated-10

Napoleon,1927,332,war,history,drama, ,3446,69 fans,4.24,12,15,16,53,59,243,314,807,651,1276," Napoleon is likely the most epic film ever made before the sweeping colour epics of Hollywood emerged. It is a grand crescendo of art and life. Everything about it is incredible as an achievement. It is a silent film of such epic proportions that you feel the weight of history, but it also has a personal intimacy that allows the film to meander on a romance for an hour. It is a wonder to behold, turning chaos into art and producing a film of emotion as well as a stunning technical showcase. Napoleon is heavy on foreshadowing. It is the depiction of a singular man, but every moment feels like it was destined. Napoleon is depicted a man who sought destiny, dreaming to restore liberty to his land and bring revolution to Europe. He was going to liberate a continent. However, whilst Napoleon is comprehensive, it is incomplete. There was meant to be many sequels to this, so the film ends early in Napoleon's life, despite the five hour runtime. Yet what we do get is a cry for revolution. Napoleon depicts a fight for the soul of France. The French Revolution remains, alongside both World Wars, the most significant event of modern Western history. Within Napoleon, France is shown in a state of terror, with the world upturned, and the dirty and the poor given the joy of watching heads roll. The shadow of the guillotine is one of the film's most powerful images. This is a tale of class, as the idle rich look down on Napoleon and his Corsican heritage stands against him. He has to carry the spirits of the revolution with him, to enshrine its legacy. He is a God, depicted with a light shining behind him, as he inspires and converts everyone he meets. Napoleon brings history alive like few films ever manage. History clashes together through insignificant coincidences, and destiny propels Napoleon Bonaparte through each these events as he rides each wave of historical immortality. This is a film with a red-tinged battle under rainfall. Ghosts of men wander through history and it is stormy fights of desperation like this that have brought us to our present day. Right from the opening fight of Napoleon, it is clear that this is a masterclass of scale and fluidity in filmmaking. It contains the most impressive of all silent era cinematography. How were they able to achieve such scale and beauty with such limited technical resources? This is film of images you will never forget, like Napoleon riding horseback chased by an army, crowds of a hundred men fighting under smoke lit by flashes of light, and the magnificent evocative silhouettes that litter the runtime. Images are overlayed and the screen is split, this is a truly innovate film that is so sophisticated in technique and the most modern of all silent cinema. It has everything besides sound, even crude animation and a small dose of slapstick humour. The score is also amazing, with loud, epic sweeps of classical music. The film's most amazing moment comes in the singing of the anthem, La Marseillaise. Through the tears of a hundred faces and a perfect feeling of expectation and spontaneity, we feel as if those on screen are singing to us. If silent film could achieve that, what couldn't be accomplished? The second half of Napoleon does not equal the first, as it gets caught in a couple of tangents. But then the incredible finale is a magnificent end to this journey. Napoleon contains many astonishing battle sequences, but the infamous triptych final battle, in the super widescreen 4.00:1 ratio, is jaw-dropping. It has a remarkable effect, creating a splintered world on an incomprehensible scale. It is moving, hypnotic, complicated, beautiful, and staggering. This is a montage dedicated to France, culminating in a final triptych in the colours of the French flag. Revolution, genius, and luck had brought Napoleon to this moment. His fate would change the world forever. On the journey of this film the world unites to go down a path of solidarity. Crass it may be, but just this once, Vive la France!",4,45,4,748,"7,954",2-Jun-20,rated-9
Napoleon,1927,332,war,history,drama, ,3446,69 fans,4.24,12,15,16,53,59,243,314,807,651,1276," For my 2000th logged film I decided I wanted to commemorate the moment with a film big enough to fit the occasion. And Abel Gance’s Napoleon was the perfect choice. An epic in every sense of the word, the film explores the life of the famed French Emperor from boyhood until his first victory as the commander of the French Army. We see the journey of a young man who feels abandoned by everyone, including the country he loves, who perceivers to become the most respected leader in the nation’s history. Rising through the ranks of a tyrannical government, Napoleon is portrayed more as an idea than an actual historical figure. An idea that could be the saving of a fleeting country to bring everyone together and back to prosperity. As it appears on screen the film’s true title, Napoléon vu par Abel Gance (Napoleon as seen by Abel Gance), we understand that the film isn’t meant to serve as a historical depiction of Napoleon but as a presentation of director’s appreciation to an almost mythological figure. And that love surely pops off the screen in some of the most stylistic filmic techniques I’ve seen. Gance is as much a character on screen as any of the actors. It’s sad in a way that the year that gave us this film, Sunrise, and Metropolis the most remembered film that year is a fairly mediocre musical solely because it introduced spoken sound. Three master silent filmmakers (among many others) at the top of their game, overshadowed by a film that would have no impact otherwise. And while sound was definitely an important development, the way Gance is able to evoke such emotion and ideas without it really brings to question how important sound really was. Gance referred to the language of cinema as the “Music of Light.” He wanted his films to portray ideas through the images more than anything. A symphony for the eyes that would bring about emotion through way of color and visuals. And the way he utilizes a variety of fairly innovative filmic techniques to so perfectly convey the story and keep the viewer engaged makes one think that if there were any sound besides the beautiful orchestral score that the whole film would fall apart.  Beginning with the most obvious, the film tinting effect is used beautifully to evoke a sense of emotion in all its scenes. The blood red instilling a sense of dread while watching brutal battle scenes. The pink conveying a sense of beauty and delicacy in its romantic scenes. Along with those we get the extraordinary (not just for its time) editing, the way it chooses to overlay shots over each other makes the presentation of the films themes more overt but far more impactful. But most impactful of all are some incredible battle sequences. Gance has said that the most important actors in his films are the crowd extras, without them the impact of the large battle and assembly hall scenes wouldn’t work nearly as well. Akin to a Greek Theater Chorus, the large crowd needs to be as convincing, if not more so, than the leads to help the audience feel as if they too are participating in the moment. When the multi-screen, triptych final act begins, you feel as if you are ready to go into battle behind Napoleon. When a large crowd comes together to sing ‘Les Marseillaise’ for the first time you can’t help but feel the wave of patriotism Gance is trying to evoke.  But of all the sequences the one that truly stunned is the ‘Two Storms.’ Even film historian Kevin Brownlow, who spent over 50 years restoring this film, said that no matter how many times he saw it he couldn’t believe how incredible it was. Using camera movements that had never been seen before (and have never been done since), Gance intercuts Napoleon stuck in a sea storm with the political ‘storm’ occurring in Paris just before Napoleon is to arrive. It sets the scene for the world as it was and the change the Napoleon was to implement. Truly beautiful. All in all, this is an incredible masterwork and I absolutely loved every second of watching it. When the final triptych tints to embody the French flag, I couldn’t help but feel speechless. That’s the kind of effect this film had over me and I’d gladly sit through the entire thing again to experience the beauty.",9,8,2,86,241,27-Mar-20,rated-10

The impressionistic and significant themes that Gance had employed on earlier films, such as with his 1924 film La Roue, foreshadowed many of the techniques utilised to their maximum effect here to establish a cinema experience that was unequalled in its day and remains impressive; with its split-screen vitality, furious cutting, powerful close-ups and much more. Gance clearly supported the view that the camera should be emancipated from being an anchored piece of equipment so that audiences could transcend just solely being passive observers, and by the manipulation of the many techniques within the film he anticipated the spectators to bound along with the narrative as it unspools in front of them. None of what's accomplished here would likely have been undertaken so passionately if Gance did not have such an enthusiastic investment in its subject, and this resulting five-and-a-half-hour masterpiece is a breathtaking milestone in film history.",2,50,4,"6,764","12,333",8-May-20,rated-10

Abel Gance didn't even need a Napoleon to be one of France's most ambitious ever filmmakers. But it stands, even against other epics like J'Accuse and La Roue, as one of the most definitive magnum opuses in cinema history. In its ridiculousness is an unmatched feeling of history at its most important, at its farthest reaching, as if each event were the end of the world. And for as stellar as some of Stanley Kubrick's films could be, and as intriguing as his version of Napoleon may sound, his mechanical interest in humanity could never be as rousing and as internal as Gance's. The weight of each sequence built on the stakes of the last, Napoleon is where the drama was meant to go. Griffith and DeMille gestured in its direction, but Gance saw the style to its pinnacle, and only ever rivalled a half-dozen times in the century to follow.

The new BFI blu ray also has an alternate single screen ending. I thought at first it was the same, but they actually insert new shots and actors (this was probably out of financial obligation - as parts of it lack the majesty of the original). Overall, a masterful work, though I found some plot points were a bit confusing, but maybe it's because of my lack of historical knowledge.

Brownlow's version, by contrast, is scored by arguably the greatest of all silent film composers, Carl Davis, his collaborator on the legendary Thames Silents project in the 1980s, and the man responsible for two of the all-time great soundtracks: The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg and The Kid Brother. And yesterday, at the Royal Festival Hall, that accompaniment came live, with Davis conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra in front of a packed house, to stunning effect. Seen in this, its true form, Napoleon is a staggering achievement, a consistently dazzling mixture of innovation, spectacle and history writ-large, where insight into character and dramatic metaphor often come courtesy of a seemingly endless box of tricks, including octuple-exposure, montages stuffed with brain-scrambling cross-cutting, and a camera that's going to go wherever Gance wants it to, with no thought as to whether such things have ever been done on screen before. The film kicks off with two of the most extraordinary sequences I've ever seen on celluloid. The first is a marriage of visual poetry and foreshadowing, saturated in its character's singular iconography, as the 10-year-old Napoleon wages war in the snowy environs of his school, Brienne, where such games are seen as a judge of character. Napoleon, an intense, unsmiling boy who lives in ""wild isolation"", is already a military mastermind, whose use of decoy, reflective vision and attack-as-defence wins him a victory against almost impossible odds. This passage climaxes with a barrage of unforgettable imagery, arresting pictures laid one on top of the other at frenetic speed, as our hero stands motionless in his battlefield, barking instructions until the glory is his. At one point, Gance even breaks out a handheld camera, at another shoots from a child's eyeline, capturing the weird dynamic of this deadly serious duel. The next set-piece, which surely influenced Jean Vigo's surrealistic masterwork Zero de conduite, released in France just six years later, has Napoleon reacting to the setting free of his (highly symbolic) pet eagle by punching everybody in his dorm room, culminating in a pillow fight that covers every frame in feathers. The pay-off, with Napoleon alone, resting on a cannon, feathers in his hair and tears dripping down his face, only for the eagle to return and a rare smile to bless his angry little face, is an image I don't think I'll ever forget. I didn't find the next two big sequences as successful, though there are superb things in both of them. The first is only tangentially related to Napoleon: a reconstruction of the first public performance of Le Marseillaise which has a few rousing moments, but only really comes to life with its introduction of the central figure (now played by Albert Dieudonné), leaning against a pillar, looking as cool as Belmondo in A bout de souffle, before turning to the camera in profile. Then the chap who wrote the anthem asks him his name - there's quite a lot of people asking other people what their names are in this film, so it can introduce both character and actor in a handy title-card. More consistent is an ingenious passage in which we see the growing dominance of mob rule, crystallised in one bloody night, as Napoleon saw it: snatches of cries, shadows and incomplete images, viewed through the grates of a run-down second floor apartment. Despite its impressive credentials, including shooting on the genuine Corsican locales where the events transpired, the next major passage lacks dramatic engagement - with too much footage of people merely sitting around - until the film announces that Napoleon is about to embark on an ""incredible adventure"" and then all hell breaks loose: there's a stunning sequence in a bar, with Napoleon rising to counter his naysayers, then an escape on horseback, and then a simply staggering sequence in which he steals a French flag from the government headquarters and uses it as a sail to evade his pursuers as he heads off into a brewing sirocco, his battle against the elements juxtaposed with a gathering storm in parliament, shot by Gance - in one of those left-centre moves that suggests you're in the presence of genuine greatness - as if it were also being rocked by the tempestuous waves. There's just time for a neat, funny cameo for Horatio Nelson, then the intermission sign flashes up. End of part one. Part two is much shorter and rather less revolutionary in both subject and style, dealing largely with the Siege of Toulon, in which Napoleon - now an artillery captain - stakes his reputation on a risky offensive against a far greater force (shadows of Brienne). There's stunning imagery to spare - rain-swept battlefields, a fleet on fire, Napoleon standing amidst the wreckage (a jawdropping image that forms the centre-piece of the event programme) - but it isn't as coherent or emotionally engaging as what precedes or what follows. The third quarter is the most tonally outrageous, in a film that doesn't give a single damn about convention, as Napoleon and Josephine - still relative strangers - are each targeted by ""the Terror"", personified by Gance's ruthless, outwardly measured Saint-Just, before engaging in a hilariously awkward courtship that can genuinely be filed under ""romantic comedy"". In between, we get a vignette about a bureaucrat who saves lives by eating execution orders, and watch Napoleon zip to national prominence by quelling an uprising with devastating defensive tactics, then we're into the ""Victims' Ball"", a decadent, shimmeringly-photographed affair, in which our grim-faced hero, chin jutting out in that formidable fashion, proves he is the sort of man who would play chess at an orgy. And win. But while the middle passages of the film are often touched with a rare brilliance, it's the first and fourth that I think give Napoleon its claims to greatness. The last is simply a tour-de-force, with two astonishing high points. As Napoleon heads to Italy to revive a tiring army, he stops at the deserted National Assembly hall. There, in the dead of night, the ghosts of the Revolution come to him, rising from the ether and next from their seats, calling on him to be the strong leader that his country needs, the dictator of an all-conquering France, then a united Europe. Allying the best of Eisenstein to the wizardry of Man with a Movie Camera and the seductive fascism of something like Gabriel Over the White House - in which liberal ends are achieved through totalitarian means - it's a piece of propaganda quite unlike anything else I've ever seen, either in form or content. The other showstopper, as you may have heard, is that ending, in which the curtain pulls away to reveal... three screens, a vast panorama, a massive canvas on which Gance can paint, as Napoleon rouses his army, rides to victory, then reflects on it all from a mountain top: images from his life rushing breathlessly across the triptych: his successes, his calculations - scribbled across endless sheets - his beloved Josephine and his nose twin, that eagle who represents his power, his utter relentlessness and his fortitude. It's the longest film I've ever seen and among the strangest, most restlessly innovative and technically astounding. There are shortcomings: the characters are generally very black and white - and sometimes too sketchily drawn or aloof to engage with - the film has a propensity for melodrama, and there are sequences that either confuse or drag. And while the acting is largely convincing, it's also - with the exception of Gance and the stony-faced Dieudonné (whose performance as the Christ-like central figure I found perhaps a little too underplayed) - done with rather broad strokes. But such things pale into gripy insignificance when put aside what it does achieve. There's a scope here, not just in terms of its epic logistics, but its destruction of cinematic barriers, that is unmatched not only in the context of silent film, but arguably within film as a whole. Gance attempts to explain Napoleon: his achievements, his character, his mind, not through dialogue, not even through performance, but via an arsenal of innovations that bring to life the man, the way he saw himself, his consuming obsessions. When Napoleon encounters Josephine at the Victims' Ball, even before he shuns the boobs to go and play chess round the corner, Gance does something so perfect that I'm amazed no-one had ever tried it before - but so inspired that it's probably no surprise at all - he cuts together, in rapid-fire motion, every meaningful, fleeting moment they've shared, like a head rush of romance, every bit as affecting as Borzage's more reflective, more obviously effusive ruminations on the same subject.

By focusing on one of the most important characters of the last decade of 18th century it is also a precise historical report of a tense and utterly significant period in Europe’s history.  Napoleon is a film of small details and numerous characters (almost all of them historical figures) and it is through this ultra-vivid structure that it finally succeeds in portraying a three dimensional and lively character who was driven by high ambitions. The film starts by showing us Napoleon’s childhood and from the opening moments it pictures a man who is determined to change the world around himself and turn it into something that he dreams of, it is not hard to understand that his patriotism and courage make him the right person to lead a nation into pride and glory. What makes the film even more exciting is that it is not only about Napoleon, but like real life the film sees him as a character in the middle of the turmoil and instability of French revolution and not just a hero living in vacuum, the fact that his story runs parallel to the story of French Revolution allows the film to give a better understanding of the circumstances which led to Bonaparte’s rise to power. Napoleon is a fascinating biopic about one of the most influential figures in the history of Europe – and the world of course, the only problems I had with the film were that A)its second half is not as inspiring and as fabulous as its first half and B) the love affair between Napoleon and Josephine lacks the warmth and strength that you expect from an epic, but despite these two minor issues it is a very delicate and exciting biopic which features some of the most eye-catching editing techniques in silent cinema and with its various characters and relaxed pace it will remind you of the kind of glory that is only achievable in literary works.

Napoleon,1927,332,war,history,drama, ,3446,69 fans,4.24,12,15,16,53,59,243,314,807,651,1276," The experience of watching an epic silent film like Napoleon for the first time is already a draining one in itself - something that I haven't felt coming towards me since I watched D. W. Griffith's Intolerance.  Prior to having seen Napoleon, I had already experienced once Abel Gance through The Wheel although I was still unready for what I was set to experience again. Reportedly it was only the first of what was supposed to be a series of five films covering Napoleon and if it were the case, then such a journey would only be heavenly to all degrees from what I can only imagine. Even trying to write about something so ahead of its own time is already a difficult challenge in itself, but ultimately only the best shows and it was unbelievably rewarding. Abel Gance's silent epic covers various facets of Napoleon's life, going from his childhood to his own romances, not forgetting his significant role within the French Revolution. Yet it is never really as simple as covering Napoleon's life where Abel Gance has managed to score such a grand triumph on the spot. Although telling the story of its own subject is one of the most important things to carry when covering the life of a figure much like Napoleon, Abel Gance has achieved something so out of the ordinary not only for his own time when he created Napoleon. Like the very best of biopics, there's a great sense of character that finds itself acquired from how it studies what has formed Napoleon's personality during the most important moments of his own life, but it's how we are being told this story that makes the film stand out so easily. To think of how much did D. W. Griffith accomplish with his 1916 epic Intolerance around three hours, Abel Gance goes even further by telling a single story spanning for near five hours in length. It is one amongst the most intimidating aspects of Napoleon but at one watches how Gance still plays a sort of subversion when it comes to what sort of an experiment is being performed on the spot. The story of Napoleon himself is split into differing segments of his own life but there's always a sense of fluidity present that ever manages to keep a consistent flow, allowing for such an intimidating running time to feel much shorter within experience. Gance assembles tidbits of the life of Napoleon onto the screen to form a different sort of experience that proves itself rewarding for what it achieves on the spot goes far beyond its own time. In part it could very well be a myth but the craft is unlike anything else out there. Every act of Napoleon finds itself dedicated to a different portion of Napoleon's life yet the fact that it comes out as a perfect setup for what is set to come else within his own life is something clever on the inside. In part it can easily be seen as a myth for there may not be so much a clear idea of Napoleon during childhood although looking upon how everything adds up to the very next moment in time and what comes forth is nothing more than only some of the finest examples of storytelling committed to a screen of any size. But what's most remarkable about how Napoleon details such moments of the figure's life is how even though a segment may feel so different in tone from the past, there is always a perfect flow and blend as a result of the editing techniques coming into play - which still stand out today. But the cohesive nature all keeps a single character's growth intact - arguably the most important facet of exploring a character like Napoleon. Amongst many of the most impressive technical achievements that were ever present in Napoleon comes the use of split screen. While there were many fast-paced edits coming then and there especially in small sequences like a snowball fight (filmed in a manner that it looks like fighting on a battlefield, hinting only at Napoleon's future from there), Gance has also achieved a visual style no other director has ever been able to match. If yet there were another thing about Napoleon coming to mind, it would be how Gance manages to give Napoleon his own presence on the screen - creating only such an insane sort of style that could never be matched again. Abel Gance's techniques still remain as fascinating now as they ever were so back in its day. I could probably write much more but it would be far too difficult of a task to uncover because everything about Napoleon finds itself flowing so perfectly on all grounds and it just blew my mind that something of this sort was made back in 1927. But even to think about how this was actually only one of what was supposed to be a saga of six films that would overall span over 30 hours, all that I could ever have imagined that if Abel Gance ever completed his vision, something godly were to be laid upon the screen on all counts. I'm not even sure how something of this sort could have ever been made the way that it was back in 1927, but alongside its technical achievements the psychological case study that it exhibits through how it explores Napoleon's life is something of another kind. One of the greatest achievements to be committed to the screen, I'm not even fairly sure this is all human.",6,71,7,"1,347","6,793",11-Feb-17,rated-10

What little I do know is thanks to this film.  He appeared to be:- A fierce nationalist.- Incredibly possessed.- A mastermind in military tactics.- And a brilliant leader.(I respect all this tremendously.) We could talk about the French revolution, which really was a product of liberalism — smashing monarchy across the globe; and leading to ""equal rights"" for all; and how the revolution allowed someone like Napoleon to rise to carve out some ""new world"" he envisioned. He definitely came across as someone who wanted to create a utopia, with a unified French people (fact checkers correct me if I'm wrong). Now, I have no clue how many people died in the crusade he was on; no clue as to the numbers of soldiers lossed; or innocent people — who knows? What I can do is speculate. I think, and hear me out, there are parallels to Hitler. Hitler also wanted to create a utopia, with a unified ""German"" people. He also was a brilliant leader and military strategist. We very well know all the casualties caught up in the holocaust, because that incident in time has countlessly been programmed into us (just stating facts). We don't know much about Napoleon. I think there are many similarities between him and Hitler. This film definitely makes me want to do more research. Sorry to bring up Hitler — this is just my mind working and I'm trying not to self censor myself. This is what I'm legitimately thinking about right now! Anyway, I could watch silent films and never get bored! This nearly 6 hour film flew by for me — I was completely engaged! We have to commend the people that restored this film — it looks amazing! As for some of the technical stuff to mention; I liked the wide shots in the final act, with all the soldiers and how they all were overlooking Italy, with Napoleon on the mountain top. That was awesome. Napoleon was leading them to the promised land, you could say. They combined 3 wide shots to give us an expansive glimpse of the magnitude and scale of war. Epic proportions.

I haven't seen this for quite a few years but today (all day) I watched this unique film on the big screen, in the 5 and a half hour Photoplay restoration with score conducted live by Carl Davis with the Philharmonia Orchestra. The story of how Kevin Brownlow has spent nearly half a century working on restoring this film to as close to Abel Gance's original vision as possible is well known - and this version, assembled in 2000 and now having a well-deserved theatrical renaissance, is possibly the last word on how the film should be presented. Abel Gance had previously directed the epic 'J'accuse' and for the subject of Napoleon Bonaparte originally planned six linked films, but after the poor critical reception to this first segment (taking Napoleon from boyhood to conquest of Italy) the plan stalled, the film was cut, and the original idea and footage was thought lost. Thanks to Photoplay - and Carl Davis' score - we can see that Gance's film (although not without its faults, including a rather stodgy mid-section concerning Napoleon's courtship of Josephine) is a really unique experience.   It has filmic tricks years ahead of their time (overlays, reflections, lighting, and the famous triptych which prefigures wide-screen projection by three decades), and despite the occasional ripe performance, has a towering central figure of authority in Albert Dieudonne as Napoleon,  while Vladimir Roudenko is impressive as the boy who grows to become the great General. From the snowball and pillow fights of Napoleon's boyhood school, to the siege of Toulon, the French Revolution, and the invasion of Italy, this film is constantly stunning and surprising.  And those final twenty minutes of triple screen bliss, eventually becoming the colours of the French flag, are the last word in patriotism. Gance never had another success in the cinema, and in fact several reference books from the 1960s and 1970s seem to assume he died young when in fact he was still alive to witness when Brownlow's first restoration was shown in 1979.  Perhaps this was the only great work he had in him. Whatever the truth, Napoleon is a great achievement, and its flaws are outweighted by a vast collection of pluses.  It also packs a large emotional punch towards the end.  Superb cinema.",9,47,1,556,"2,467",30-Nov-13,rated-10

Just a few thoughts then. Richard Widmark. That seems like a good place to start. This is only the fourth film I’ve seen with him, but I’m looking forward very much to seeing more. He’s an interesting actor, like a less mysterious McQueen, or a less annoying Kinski. And I like those challenging, inquiring eyes. I’m not surprised chicks don’t notice they’re getting robbed while he’s staring at them.  Jean Peters has got amazing eyes, too (not to mention a beautiful face). Her performance sparkles as much as those big innocent eyes that speak of an honest heart. Some dames are bullshitters, I don’t always like the noir woman, but this isn’t a femme fatale—this is a gal who will make your life better, because she means the words she says. A Hawksian woman, she is the heart of this film and softens and potentially even wisens up Widmark’s character. So it’s also a love story, and a beautiful one at that. Romantic in the right way, zero schmaltz.  The moment when they first kiss has got to be one of the weirdest but also sexiest seduction scenes I’ve ever seen. Kinda kinky! I have never seen Peters in anything else before, and although I’ve read that this is her most accomplished role, I definitely want to seek out more of her films.  So you see, this film was very much about the eyes for me. I don’t know if all these actors just happen to have amazing eyes, or if it’s the way Fuller decided to light them like stars, either way it’s a testament of a truly perceptive and intuitive director. All the way down to the police station the eyes speak… the old officer’s eyes are forgiving and wise (he’s seen it all), the younger officer’s are inquisitive and skeptical (he’s still got places to go). The bad guy squints and his eyelids seem heavy, as if he’d prefer to go through his life asleep. And then there’s Moe (played by Thelma Ritter), whose eyes reveal the sadness she holds but also the cleverness that gets her through life.  The camera work is a dream, New York is so alive and the whole thing is atmospherically so dense it’s like you’re right there. The mood reminded me very much of On the Waterfront. Some noirs try hard to be noir, some noirs are too aware that they’re noir, this one walks into the darkness like it’s nothing. An unconventional noir, a superb drama, and an unforgettable film.

The Massachusetts native formulates a ferociously filtered film which follows Skip McCoy, portrayed by Richard Widmark, as a pickpocket who unintentionally pilfers some sensitive intel and comes to be the target of communist spies. McCoy is a stubbornly obstinate central character which Widmark plays with layered mannerism, and the film also has an excellent performance from Thelma Ritter as informant Moe Williams. Fuller's pomposity for physical forcefulness is in attendance along with this serving as a well concise interpretation of techniques and themes which he would continually revisit throughout his career. The central character discharges mid-fifties street credibility at almost every opportunity, which was hardly the norm for onscreen nationalists at the time, and it results in this functioning not just as a cold war drama, but also, due to its many characteristics, as one outgrown from the film noir genre.",2,39,2,"6,764","12,333",8-Jul-20,rated-8

At just eighty minutes in length it condenses a blistering narrative of double crossing, communists, guns, dames, smoking in diners and brutal violence, all the while populated with pulpy dialogue that sounds like it was lifted straight from a hardboiled detective novel. Richard Widmark is perfectly cast as a petty thief, his performance carrying the right amount of sleazy mystery and sizzling romanticism to carry the performance and is a great match for Jean Peters, who despite getting slapped around in some nasty male encounters, manages to turn the tables as she holds her own. The seedy characters and terse dialogue comes dangerously close to the pitfall of cliche, but it remains remarkably fresh and entirely believable thanks to Fuller's energetic and scintillating direction. There are hints of the social issues that he would go on to tackle in later work like Shock Corridor and White Dog but it remains fully grounded in its storytelling, even if the political leanings are a little suspect.",3,14,2,643,"1,234",14-Apr-18,rated-8

This baroque sensibility seems a perfect match for the film's lurid subject matter, turning an already sharp script which deals in the ugly realities of petty crime into a film which seems to move between violence (a brutal, shocking violence), eroticism and melancholy with little to no effort. It's quite clearly positioned as an 'anti-communist' picture, but Fuller's grasp on the politics of his time muddles what in anyone else's hands could have been a rather black and white portrait - he's much more interested in exploring the way his criminals act and behave, always digging deeper into what makes the film's central pickpocket 'tick'. The highlight of the picture - a senseless murder which begins within one of the film's only quiet moments of contemplation - is breathtaking in the way it seems to meld empathy with brutality, in many ways representative of the tonal tight-rope Fuller manages to walk throughout the entire film.

Actually, ""with anger"" might be a better descriptor.  During an early scene where Jean Peters' Candy enters a building, steps into a phone booth, and leaves, Fuller's camera swiftly tracks with and around her.  During that scene, Fuller also cuts to Joey, Candy's ex, on the other end of the line.  When he does, the camera rushes, not pushes, into his face, framing him in, what was for the time, an extreme close-up.  A fair portion of the film is shot in close-ups, actually.  For example, the first scene on the subway train takes on a sexual subtext partially because of Fuller's use of close-ups.  As Skip pickpockets Candy's purse, Fuller cuts between tight close-ups of their respective, sweaty faces.  Candy simmers with sultry lust, while Skip's eyes eat her up.  Inserts of Skip ""The Cannon's"" fingers delicately penetrating the crevasse of the purse complete the montage, turning an act of theft into an orgasmic experience. After that intimate interaction, these characters glom onto each other, slowly developing a perverse affection for one another.  Candy only gravitates towards Skip after he has abused and humiliated her, just as Skip finally falls for her only after she's taken a beating and a bullet for him.  As Fuller states on the Criterion edition, these characters stand for nothing, they are lowlifes desperate for survival.

The justly celebrated opening is cinema itself, pure and tingling: A crowded, clattering subway car, a moist passenger (Jean Peters) absent-mindedly biting her lower lip while a crafty pickpocket (Richard Widmark) tickles the innards of her purse, plus a couple of FBI agents who can’t quite believe their eyes. She’s a Commie agent’s patsy, her filched wallet holds microfilm of military secrets, ""you look for oil and sometimes you hit a gusher."" With no use for ""patriotic eyewash,"" the scoundrel in the waterfront shack is ready to sell the MacGuffin to the highest bidder until the moll and a professional snitch (Thelma Ritter) awaken his grubby sense of honor. Cold War anxiety merely heightens the already-combustible fabric of everyday America in Samuel Fuller’s two-fisted masterpiece, characters are always scavenging and knocking around for the top of the heap. (People inform on each other with no hesitation or rancor, ""he’s gotta live,"" ""she’s gotta eat,"" it’s just business until it’s not.) Far from reviling them, Fuller loves these scroungers as the closet defenders of the lopsided system that’s marginalized them, contrasting their gritty tenacity with the cravenness of peculiarly plutocratic Reds filmed in parodic Soviet close-ups. The phenomenally virile camerawork takes off from Kurosawa’s Stray Dog and improves on it, pushing whole sequences (Widmark cuffs Peters, revives her with splashed beer, and seduces her by rubbing her bruised jaw) beyond noir tropes and into the realm of batty lyricism. Widmark’s jackal impudence and Peters’ ripe sneer-pout are lovely comic-strip details suspended between Runyon and Bukowski, and then there’s the bowery Shakespeare of Ritter’s doomed stoolie -- wily, dilapidated, hardboiled and palpably weary, pining for a fancy funeral and confronting the Reaper’s record-scratch in perhaps the tenderest moment Fuller ever shot.

Really overwhelming first-time watch; for my initial ranking I've placed it in the top 25 of all film noir, alongside stuff like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, and The Third Man. No idea if it'll retain this position, but that should give you a sense of how impressed I was with it—and how intimidated I am to write about it.  Structurally, the editing is incredibly well controlled, to the point that it feels like some golden-age Hitchcock, using eyeline matches to imply intent and meaning; thematically, there's so much rich development of the idea that film noir is a reaction to urbanization and the expansion of capitalist exploitation after WWII—the subway plays a central role in the narrative, and people are constantly selling each other out and complaining about their inability to afford the cost of living.  This came out in the late days of the strictest enforcement of the Hays Code, and it really feels like Fuller & co. have mastered how to make a movie that's anti-communist on the surface (""What's the matter with you? Playing footsie with the Commies!"") but anti-capitalist beneath (the informant is saving money to for a plot of land in a nice graveyard, the most existential of anti-capitalist noir sentiments)—even the mcguffin is essentially a symbol of America's abuse of power, its dirty secrets, and its persecution of cumminist ideology.  Hopefully I'll have a chance to watch this again before I need to return it to the library.

Fast moving, and soaked in the “underworld” the film opens with a couple of mugs watching a dame on the subway, then another fellow moves next to her and picks her wallet right out of her purse and then slips right off the subway before anyone can follow him. The mugs follow the dame but she doesn’t lead them to anything because she bails when she finds out she doesn’t have the goods. Enter the greatest thing in the film, the incomparable Thelma Ritter sauntering in as an expert on the New York City pickpockets. She quickly fingers the guy in a fabulous scene where she interrogates the cops. Then she works over the Sargent to get paid for her work.  Then in a whirling series of back and forth rapid fire plot developments (industrial espionage, commies, murder most foul!) we finally wind up with nick fighting his way through a subway to avenge the girl he loves. The brilliance is really in the editing that keeps everything moving at breakneck speed, but also in the writing that provides the clarity to move so fast and the visuals that economically do the same.

I'm only three films into his filmography and I can tell he is a filmmaker of considerable talent, one who could maybe end up amongst the ranks of Nic Ray, (maybe it's fitting the both appear in Wim Wenders' The American Friend). What lets Pickup on South Street fall from being a near-masterpiece is the slightly uneven plot and the focus on Richard Widmark when Jean Peters is easily the more interesting character and screen presence.

He is unafraid to bare all of the grit, the darkness, and the brutality of a underworld mystery full of violence and intrigue. I think handling in this manner and using Fuller's array of different characters creates a higher level of realism that is usually not present during other Noir films. A example of this with the characters he wrote would be that every single one was unlikeable, greedy, and self centered. These characters suffered from the real life imperfections that a number of reasons could have brought upon them (reasons that can only be pondered but never told and that eliminates any chance of sympathy the viewer has for them). All except Thelma Ritter's ""Moe"" perhaps, you could certainly say the viewer carries sympathy for her character and her final scene was absolutely shattering to the mind and spirit. Her performance was the best in the film and probably of her career. Pickup On South Street is a top notch Noir and brutal and suspenseful as they come.

Fuller's films are often defined by their content - he tended to be fearless with his stories, tackling social issues that most other directors were comfortable ignoring.  This is maintained in Pickup on South Street, though its presentation is far more subtle than, say, The Steel Helmet.  The tension of the Cold War is very palpable underneath the film's surface; although not necessarily making a statement on the Cold War itself, Pickup on South Street certainly captures the paranoia of the period.  Yet, what is perhaps more interesting is the way in which women are used in this film.  Although often described as a noir, Pickup diverts from many of the archetypes established by the genre.  Personally, I have a lot of reservations about the genre - I find many of the works to be rather sexist (and that's putting it lightly).  What I appreciate about Pickup on South Street is that it is far more conscious of how it treats its female characters.  Unlike the majority of noirs, for which women (particularly powerful women) are villainous, the women in Pickup on South Street are generally given more respect.  They aren't painted as villains - in fact, it is those who mistreat women who are made out to be the villains.  Pickup feels more morally conscious, more socially aware, than the general film noir, which makes it leagues more impressive than the other films of the genre.  It would be a stretch to call it a revisionist noir, yet I would argue that it definitely provides smaller revisions of the genre. Unlike the other features of his I've seen thus far, Fuller gets far better performances across the board.  With Fuller films, there is generally an unmistakable campiness to them.  In some cases, such as White Dog, that campy feel is part of their charm.  Yet I will say that it is refreshing to see such impressive acting in a Fuller film - his writing often deserves it.   Furthermore, I found his formal technique to be much more interesting here than it has been in previous features (or, at the very least, it was made more noticeable here).  Fuller has this great way of transitioning from a medium or full shot into a close up with a simple dolly, limiting the number of cuts within a scene.  While I'm by no means against heavy editing - Von Trier, after all, is my favorite filmmaker - I found these slight gestures of the camera to be really brilliant.  It smoothly enables a scene to transition to and from intimate moments, allowing the camera to get in close with the actors with ease.  This technique is even more impressive during fight scenes: during a brief scene of domestic abuse, Fuller uses dollies to enable us to get an unbroken look at the violence, which makes the moment all that more uncomfortable and powerful. I may not be wholly sold on Fuller - I definitely enjoy his films, though I never find myself adoring them as some do - but I can most certainly see the brilliance of this work.",4,6,0,373,"2,019",19-Sep-15,rated-9

I always love a hokey Hollywood romance, but the accelerated attraction between Skip and Candy didn't connect with me here. It might be the characters in general, which felt a little too stiff and unlikeable, but that might have been because of the screenplay, which wasn't as winding or emotionally intense as something like Shockproof. Thankfully Thelma Ritter appears often with a dirty, charismatic, and hard-hitting performance. Pickup on South Street also features some of Fuller's best action moments and his typical close-up heavy camerawork and interesting framing. The story brims with Communist anxiety, but instead of raising the emotional stakes to government secrets let slip (as Notorious did), Fuller keeps Skip and Candy's conflicts in the spotlight.

This noir exhibits true grit; every character is out to make a fast buck and there's very little room for sentimentality - any romance there is is born of violence and retains an edginess throughout. It's a world of predators and parasites and everyone's got a price: Skip McCoy, Joey, even the police are paying stool pigeon Moe Williams for her intel. What begins as a simple pickpocket on the underground turns into a three-way chase for the stolen goods - the wallet Skip lifted from Candy's bag turns out to contain a microfilm of an unspecified chemical formula, with obvious nuclear potential, and it's wanted by both the FBI and a faction of communist sympathizers they're tracking. Pickup On South Street has got a bit of bad rep for its anti-communist stance, but considering the time of its production - under intense scrutiny from HUAC in the year McCarthy took office - it's not that hard to understand why the studio would go down the red threat route, with one eye on potential returns and the viability of their asset. But it's well worth looking beyond the film's ideological leanings, because there's something special here - a brilliantly paced, aesthetically stunning but above all character-driven drama, that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go till its protagonists walk out the door. Richard Widmark is bang on form as Skip McCoy, a two-bit con who stumbles on a big score, out of his depth but using all of his considerable street smarts to beat the odds, evincing viciousness and charm in equal measure. Jean Peters is gorgeous in her trademark white dress, both street wise and naive, and the character you really root for - Widmark might get top billing, but she's really at the heart of the thing, bringing it all together. Maybe the most enjoyable performance though comes courtesy of Thelma Ritter, world-weary and cynical but in the end, the most principled of them all - her death-bed monologue is heartbreaking. The way conversations between characters are shot is interesting - often close up with soft focus, which brings an intimacy and realism to their interactions that is sometimes lacking in noir, when it's more about the intricacies of the plot. The microfilm here is just a MacGuffin to bring these characters together; the strength of their personalities is the driving force. This is without a doubt one of the best film noirs I've watched - cracks my top 10 with ease. There are so many memorable scenes and locations: Skip's waterfront shack (amusingly, the least secret hideout imaginable; the entrance is like a revolving door, ushering in the feds, the reds or a dangerous liaison at any given moment), a crate-on-a-rope-in-the-river makeshift refrigerator, desperate escape through a dumb waiter, the extended tracking shot of the film's climax, a punch-up in a train station that spills onto the tracks, slugging it out in semi darkness while a crowd of onlookers are framed in a small rectangle of light that forms the tunnel entrance. The framing and shot composition are phenomenal, really capturing the texture of the city. Looming over all is the spectre of New York at its grittiest, most paranoia-inducing and claustrophobic; a shadow-bound concrete jungle that consumes the souls of all but the toughest of grifters.",4,24,11,627,"1,108",3-Oct-18,rated-9

This is by far the most thrilling, grimy, slum dunk of a Sam Fuller outing I've seen. Pickup on South Street starts already cranked up to eleven. We open on a sweaty, crowded train in the middle of a pick-pocketing. Fuller then throws us into an intense hunt with global consequences, the details of the story leaking out mid-action. It's violent and nasty. The fight scenes are brutal and unhinged. The dialogue is catty and mean. The characters have names like Skip, Candy, and Tiger. The casting is perfect. Jean Peters is amazing and comes across as genuinely street smart. Richard Widmark has just the right blend of slime and heart. Best of all is Thelma Ritter as Moe. Ritter is brilliant in everything I've seen her in, but this could well be my favourite role of hers. She absolutely shines as the tie-selling, swindling oracle of the underworld. Pickup on South Street never lets up. Fuller builds and builds to a final act that is nonstop in its action, culminating in a jaw-dropping fisticuffs that has to be seen to be believed. Beyond its fantastic pace and execution, Fuller also says things here that are extraordinarily bold. In this world, crooks aren't so bad and if they don't cross the line into treason they won't be punished. It's pretty exciting to see a film where the hero is a lowly pickpocket.

Hughes, “Geoffrey Homes” (Daniel Mainwaring), Jim Thompson, Patricia Highsmith, Ross Macdonald, Donald E. Westlake, Ed McBain, Richard Stark; sólo, muy tardíamente y “en Europa”, ha adaptado al marginal David Goodis en Calle sin retorno (Sans espoir de retour, 1989)–; sin vocación o aspecto semidocumental –como tantas películas Warner de los años 30, o Fox de los 40, y sobre todo, entre estas últimas, las producidas por Louis de Rochemont– ni apoyo en sucesos reales-históricos o de “palpitante actualidad”, como las diversas campañas contra el crimen organizado, la delincuencia juvenil, el narcotráfico–, carecen de la imaginería mítica que fundamenta el perenne atractivo del género, sobre todo para los europeos, y también –consecuentemente– de protagonistas carismáticos –detectives privados o policías ejemplares– o bigger than life –pintorescos y truculentos villanos, melómanos y megalómanos, crueles y omnipotentes–, todo lo cual es, en el fondo, bastante lógico, ya que en las obras completas de Fuller no abundan los héroes ni los antihéroes, sino que predominan la ambigüedad de las “medias tintas” y los comportamientos contradictorios de la esquizofrenia latente o rampante. La ausencia casi total de estrellas características del género –junto a la ocasional aparición de sus más destacados secundarios– no puede atribuirse meramente a la falta de presupuesto, cuya insuficiencia se ve siempre con creces compensada a fuerza de imaginación y astuta economía narrativa –es decir, como en la serie B, pero sin que por ello las películas de Fuller dejen de ser obras netamente personales e identificables a simple vista como exclusivamente “suyas”, y por tanto ajenas a toda idea de “serie” o de sistema de fabricación–, ya que a menudo empleaba a actores de no menor cotización, pero desusados o sorprendentes en el género. De hecho, son el propio individualismo y la muy deliberadamente buscada originalidad de tono, planteamiento y estilo que caracterizan el cine independiente de Fuller lo que hace sumamente dudosa y conflictiva la clasificación de su obra por “géneros”. Como luego el de Godard, el cine de Fuller constituye “un género en sí mismo”, que aprovecha algunos aspectos de los modelos o patrones genéricos preexistentes y establecidos, pero sirviéndose de ellos como de un repertorio o un muestrario, y de un modo tan libre, anticonvencional, personal y antiacadémico que, por ejemplo, sus westerns son todos ellos “aberrantes”, sus películas de guerra poco tienen que ver con las habituales, y su cine “negro” en nada se parece a El halcón maltés (The Maltese Falcon, 1941), El sueño eterno (The Big Sleep, 1946), Retorno al pasado (Out of the Past, 1947) o La jungla del asfalto (The Asphalt Jungle, 1950), y guarda más relación, en todo caso, con “anomalías” como Persecución en la noche (Ride the Pink Horse, 1947), La dama de Shanghai (The Lady from Shanghai, 1947), Almas desnudas (The Reckless Moment, 1949) o Sed de mal (Touch of Evil, 1958)… o las prefigura, como A quemarropa (Point Blank, 1967) de John Boorman, para mí claramente tributaria de Underworld USA (“Bajos fondos USA, 1960), hábilmente cruzada con Código del hampa (The Killers, 1964) de Don Siegel, o, más todavía, Manhattan Sur (The Year of the Dragon, 1985) de Michael Cimino, que debe mucho también a La casa de bambú, y no poco a The Crimson Kimono. Cuando se habla de cine ""negro”, los ejemplos que vienen primero a la memoria son varios interpretados por Bogart –aunque no suelan recordarse películas tan inolvidables como The Roaring Twenties (“Los rugientes años veinte”, 1939) y El último refugio (High Sierra, 1941) de Raoul Walsh, The Big Shot (“El gran disparo”, 1942) de Lewis B. Seiler o Callejón sin salida (Dead Reckoning, 1947) de John Cromwell–, fundamentalmente la inaugural El halcón maltés (1941) de John Huston y la paradigmática El sueño eterno (1946), que hace que figure en todas las antologías un nombre tan alejado habitualmente del género –a pesar de la precursora Scarface, el terror del hampa (Scarface, Shame of a Nation, 1932)– como el de Howard Hawks. A continuación, se van añadiendo obras de Robert Siodmak, Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, Raoul Walsh, Jules Dassin, John Berry, Anatole Litvak… hasta llegar a cineastas exóticos como Jacques Tourneur, John Brahm, André De Toth, Joseph H. Lewis, Phil Karlson o Edgar G. Ulmer, pero muy raramente se piensa en Fuller. Por eso no acaba de ser escandaloso, aunque a mí me resulte un poco extraño, que el nombre de Fuller ni siquiera aparezca en el índice onomástico de una colección de ensayos tan interesante como el recientísimo “The Movie Book of Film Noir” (editado por Ian Cameron, Studio Vista, Londres, 1992), obra, en general, de críticos admiradores de este cineasta, y que no se estudie en sus páginas ninguna de sus películas (sólo se cita, una vez y de pasada, Pickup on South Street), pese a que veinte años antes Colin McArthur, además de pedirle prestado el no muy original título de “Underworld USA” (Cinema One Series, Secker & Warburg, Londres, 1972), le dedicase un interesante capítulo. Pero estamos acostumbrados a su ausencia, como a que todavía haya diccionarios que le ignoran, y encima durante los últimos años ha caído un tanto en el olvido. Ahora bien, y en buena medida porque Fuller es un cineasta “disidente” y rebelde frente a las normas –todas, desde las narrativas a las estéticas, desde las que rigen los géneros a las que determinan los raccords, desde las que conforman lo que hoy se llamaría politically correct y antes “progresista” hasta las que definen en cada momento lo que la sociedad entiende por “buen gusto” y está dispuesta a aceptar de buen grado–, una porción considerable de su filmografía, cualesquiera que sean la época en que acaecen los hechos narrados y la fecha de realización de la película, puede asimilarse a la “crónica negra” de la sociedad que describe. Esta propensión no es rara: para comprenderla, basta recordar que Fuller se formó como reportero “de sucesos”, aunque conviene no olvidar que antes de convertirse en guionista y director de cine escribió novelas “policiacas”, lo que a su vez explica la facilidad con que sus películas pronto abandonan el realismo de partida –el trampolín de la normalidad– para adentrarse decidida y osadamente en la más pura y descabellada ficción. El más superficial análisis revela que Fuller antepone la eficacia dramática y “su propia fruición como narrador” a toda idea de “verosimilitud” o de “probabilidad estadística”, que presta más atención a la lógica interna de los personajes y las situaciones en que se ven envueltos que a cualquier pauta impuesta desde el exterior, provenga de la tradición o de una moda. Escuchar a Fuller contar o describir una película, tanto ya realizada como sólo escrita o meramente imaginada, o leer las entrevistas largas –en las que se dedica a hacer eso en cuanto le dejan sus interlocutores– demuestra el carácter eminentemente visual y efectista de su inventiva, y lleva a sospechar que se le ocurren las ideas a un ritmo muy superior al que es capaz de contarlas, tanto oralmente como, más tarde, en la pantalla, impresión que sus películas menos conseguidas confirman, en especial algunas de las últimas basadas en sus propias novelas. El duro aprendizaje periodístico de Fuller es uno de los factores “estilísticos” que fundamentan su forma de entender el cine. Por eso busca el dramatismo, la espectacularidad y el impacto, que le tientan hasta bordear el sensacionalismo. De ahí también su inveterada afición a la polémica y el debate. Si coquetea en ocasiones con lo que peyorativamente suele llamarse “cine de tesis” –aunque al menos las suyas suelen ser propias y originales, cuando no estrafalarias y paradójicas, y siempre se sitúan provocativamente “a contrapelo” de lo que “se lleva” o está “bien visto”, lo que las hace especialmente irritantes para los dogmáticos y los propensos a dejarse llevar por la corriente– es porque tiende a introducir comentarios “editoriales”, para colmo de una heterodoxia que ningún director de periódico le permitiría, por temor a perder lectores o crearse conflictos. De ahí le viene también, probablemente, una desmedida afición a abordar “grandes temas” amplios y generales, preferentemente ilustrados –casi simbólicamente– mediante pequeñas anécdotas, que se van complicando y entremezclando hasta acabar por resultar de un barroquismo notable. Es el lado “parabólico”, de morality play, con claros antecedentes en el “Moby Dick” de Herman Melville, y en la Biblia, que han comentado a menudo sus exégetas –para ser preciso, sólo los anglosajones, de los cuales los mejores son todos ingleses, y además discípulos más o menos remotos del prestigioso y polémico crítico literario F. R. Leavis–, y que puede chocar con su modestia económica. Su permanente conflicto con la estrechez de recursos materiales y temporales que impone en Hollywood el afán de independencia impulsa a Fuller, para acercarse a sus ambiciosas metas, a jugar con la confrontación y el contraste; cuando dos personajes se enfrentan, asistimos gráficamente al choque de dos posturas, dos grupos de interés, dos ideologías, que no necesitan de grandes discursos para exponer sus puntos de vista. Se trata, casi siempre, de una lucha a muerte entre organizaciones o individuos de intereses contrapuestos o rivales, pero que se sirven de medios y “métodos” muy semejantes; esta similitud facilita que Fuller cultive la figura dramática más cargada de ambivalencia: la “infiltración” de un grupo por un solitario, cuyo afán de venganza personal es aprovechado por la banda rival –o la policía– para destruir desde dentro la organización enemiga “penetrada”. No es raro que un personaje de “infiltrado” atraiga a Fuller, ya que suele ser, por lo menos, un disidente, y además puede convertirse en un traidor, un agente involuntario o un espía a la fuerza. Hay ejemplos de ello en sus westerns –como Bob Ford en Balas vengadoras (I Shot Jesse James, 1949), el sudista renegado (Rod Steiger) y el indio que ha sido scout o guía de la caballería (Jay C. Flippen) en Yuma (Run of the Arrow, 1957), el celoso Dean Jagger de Forty Guns (“Cuarenta pistolas”, 1957)–, pero abundan , sobre todo, en las películas más próximas al cine “negro”, desde Manos peligrosas y La casa de bambú hasta Underworld USA, sin olvidar Corredor sin retorno y Una luz en el hampa; incluso en películas de guerra –al menos como sospecha, en Casco de acero (The Steel Helmet, 1951)– o a mitad de camino entre ambos géneros –como Verboten! (“¡Prohibido!”, 1958)– se dan este tipo de situaciones o de duplicidades de los personajes. Nada debe la preeminencia de este tema en Manos peligrosas –Richard Widmark, Jean Peters y Thelma Ritter, los tres protagonistas, son traidores o delatores–, por tanto, a la histeria McCarthista con la que injustamente se le ha relacionado; igualmente, cuando se habla de maniqueísmo a propósito de Fuller se está recurriendo a un insulto que no resiste el más somero análisis de sus películas. Como corolario, puede observarse que, aunque su mejor y más activa etapa creadora coincida –como en el cine americano en general– con la doble presidencia de Eisenhower, no hay en su cine el menor asomo de apología del American Way of Life entonces triunfante e imperante ya en medio mundo, que tan corrosivamente diseccionaron los europeos ilustrados instalados en Hollywood –Fritz Lang, Otto Preminger, Douglas Sirk–, pero que el grueso del cine americano se limitaba a ilustrar y propagar, con excepciones críticas –los melodramas de Nicholas Ray o Vincente Minnelli, por ejemplo–, pero que incluso buena parte del cine “policiaco”, sobre todo el que apoya la lucha contra el crimen organizado o la corrupción local, apoyaba implícitamente. Aunque las imágenes de Fuller son tan llamativas y chocantes que se piensa en él, sobre todo, como un realizador –cuando es, con Nicholas Ray, Joseph L. Mankiewicz y Orson Welles, uno de los pocos cineastas americanos de su generación con “conciencia de autor”, totalmente responsable de sus obras–, conviene, insisto, tener siempre presente que Fuller es, ante todo, un escritor, un periodista y un novelista. Eso explica su afición al negro sobre blanco de la letra impresa en las páginas de un libro o de un diario, con lo que ello implica, a la vez, de precisión y de esquematismo –o de predisposición a cargar las tintas–, pero también de afán de abarcar el máximo territorio y de investigar a fondo en sus rincones y recovecos, de mostrar luces y sombras, de ir más allá de la apariencia y de las contradicciones y paradojas, de bucear en la ambigüedad aun a riesgo de no siempre conseguir escapar de ella. Fuller fue también, antes de llegar a reportero, vendedor callejero de periódicos, y sabe por experiencia práctica la importancia y la eficacia de un gran titular llamativo, de una frase chocante, de una foto elocuente, de un recuadro de opinión en primera plana. Se podría pensar que, además de todo eso, y aunque no he encontrado el menor rastro de semejante actividad, también cultivó el cartelismo publicitario, o el diseño de portadas de novelas de bolsillo, ya que muchos de sus planos tienen la gráfica y algo tosca expresividad de un póster –político o comercial– o de la cubierta de una edición barata, y otros son como pancartas, u octavillas lanzadas a la sala de cine, o como grandes murales, vallas o dazibaos ofrecidos a la mirada del espectador. También debió frecuentar durante algún tiempo las ondas, a la vista de su interés por el sonido y la perspectiva acústica, su empleo de la música y su afición a interpelar directamente al espectador, mediante una voz en off –o un letrero– que le interroga y que a menudo reemplaza el clásico “The End”. El colmo de esta tendencia a implicar al público en sus películas lo ilustra la idea delirante de propugnar que en las películas de guerra silbaran las balas sobre las cabezas de los espectadores, a ser posible –sospecho– con munición real. Precisamente por no ser ni mitificador, ni desesperado, ni romántico, ni documental, ni denunciador, ni ejemplarizante, el cine que –con reservas, aunque no sin cierto fundamento– podríamos calificar de “negro” dentro de la obra de Fuller es mucho más sombrío y más tajante, más crítico e inconformista, menos engañosamente esperanzador que ningún otro, es decir, si se quiere, más “negro” todavía. Lo que, mediante el relato de una historia particular compleja y dinámica, Fuller describe –como “de pasada”, sin anunciarlo– es precisamente el rostro “normal” –cotidiano, ordinario, oficioso, apenas sumergido, funcional, rutinario e insensible– del hampa y de la corrupción. Y tanto la colectiva –el pueblo fronterizo de Una luz en el hampa, la gran ciudad que alimenta la crónica del diario The Globe en Park Row (“Park Row”, 1952), los Estados Unidos representados en un microcosmos que no es ya una diligencia, un hotel, un barco o un avión, sino el manicomio de Corredor sin retorno– como la individual –el pervertido e hipócrita prohombre-mecenas-benefactor de Una luz en el hampa, el periodista que se hace pasar por loco en Corredor sin retorno meramente con el propósito de ganar el codiciado premio Pulitzer–; la lógica implacable de la actuación de las organizaciones criminales –la mafia de Underworld USA, la banda-patrulla de ejército de ocupación que opera en el Japón de postguerra retratado en La casa de bambú, el círculo vicioso de espionaje-delación, fundamentado en la traición obtenida mediante soborno o chantaje, de Manos peligrosas– o policiales; los conflictos raciales y sociales que permanecen latentes en el gran melting pot integrador que es –o debiera ser– América para Fuller: véase, en particular, The Crimson Kimono, aunque es una obsesión omnipresente, desde The Baron of Arizona (“El Barón de Arizona”, 1950) a Uno Rojo, división de choque (The Big Red One, 1980) y Perro blanco, pasando por Yuma, China Gate (“La Puerta de China”, 1957) o Corredor sin retorno. Como el no muy apreciado novelista Ross Macdonald –que algún día será revalorizado, tras Hammett y Chandler, y reconocido a su lado como uno de los grandes maestros literarios y éticos del género–, Fuller parece haber comprendido instintivamente que la mejor forma de representar el mundo contemporáneo en tiempos de paz consiste en tratar de describir el permanente y ambiguo enfrentamiento entre las fuerzas de la ley y las del hampa, combate no siempre violento, a veces subterráneo y hasta secreto, en el que ambas organizaciones complementarias bordeaban a menudo la ilegalidad y se servían de medios, en última instancia, no excesivamente distintos. También comprendió pronto que el empeño del artista –escritor o cineasta, para el caso, daba igual– para abrirse camino entre la maraña de intrigas, relaciones, intereses, sociedades instrumentales y personas “usadas” por unos y otros sin demasiados escrúpulos y en muchas ocasiones a la fuerza –bajo presión o amenaza, con promesas de inmunidad o perdón, con recompensas u ofertas de protección– era, en gran medida, paralelo al trabajo de investigación que tenía que llevar a cabo un detective o un periodista, por lo que tales personajes y su forma de operar representaban un modelo válido para la conducción del relato y para transmitir dramáticamente, y a ser posible con amenidad, al espectador su visión del caos y la corrupción reinantes. Esto es lo que hace, más allá de discrepancias formales y de su muy superior dureza, que el de Fuller esté claramente emparentado con el llamado “cine negro”, siempre que su acción sucede hoy en día y mientras no se trate de un relato bélico. Y conviene observar que esto ocurre, sobre todo, cuando el escenario son los Estados Unidos: de películas situadas en México (como Arma de dos filos) o, más todavía, en Europa, como la francesa Ladrones en la noche (Les voleurs de la nuit, 1983) o la portuguesa Calle sin retorno, no cabría decir lo mismo, a pesar de que la primera tenga concomitancias –el tipo de mujer que encama Silvia Pinal– con los ejemplos más “míticos” del género y sus diálogos evoquen los de otros thrillers “exóticos”, como Una aventurera en Macao (Macao, 1952) de Josef von Sternberg, o las novelas de Charles Williams, de que tiendan a presentar personajes de americanos exiliados, y de que la tercera, producida por el realizador francés Jacques Bral –autor de Extérieur nuit y Polar–, adapte la novela “negra” homónima del escritor norteamericano David Goodis. Esto indica que no se trata, pues, por parte de Fuller, de una opción formal, ni de aprovechar los rasgos convencionales que caracterizan al género como un envoltorio más o menos “atractivo” o comercial, sino de una concomitancia más radical, interior y esencial, basada en una visión crítica de la realidad moral –más que social– de su país. Incluso creo significativo que Ladrones en la noche, que podría considerarse una versión actualizada de la historia contada por Fritz Lang en Sólo se vive una vez (You Only Live Once, 1937) y Nicholas Ray en They Live By Night (“Ellos viven de noche”, 1948), se parezca mucho menos a Bonnie y Clyde (Bonnie and Clyde, 1967) de Arthur Penn o Thieves Like Us (“Ladrones como nosotros”, 1974) de Robert Altman que a otras películas sobre jóvenes desarraigados en París que viven y mueren al borde de la delincuencia, pero que nada tienen en común con el cine “negro” de ningún continente ni con su imaginería clásica, El diablo probablemente (Le Diable probablement, 1977) y El dinero (L'argent, 1982) de Robert Bresson, mientras que Calle sin retorno se convierte en una visión abstracta, fragmentaria, heterogénea y alucinada, más cercana a una pesadilla que a cualquier enfoque de la realidad, por estilizado o distorsionado que pueda ser, y por tanto más emparentada –lógicamente– con Muerte de un pichón (Kressin und die tote Taube in der Beethovenstrasse, 1972) del propio Fuller que con muestras del género perfectamente aclimatadas al continente europeo como El silencio de un hombre (Le samouraï, 1967) o El círculo rojo (Le cercle rouge, 1970), personalísimas obras de Jean-Pierre Melville o con las películas más logradas de José Giovanni o Claude Sautet. De hecho, es el desarraigo involuntario lo que, al convertir en “apátridas” las últimas incursiones más o menos “negras” de Fuller, privándolas de sustento en la realidad, aunque fuera como mero trampolín para su fantasía, las aproxima a una serie de convenciones que le son ajenas y hace que no sean tan “negras” como sus películas americanas más alejadas, en principio, del género, como Park Row.

No one speaks, but everyone glances; some at the floor or out the window, others at unsuspecting passengers, yet all attempting in one way or another to not betray what’s truly on their mind. Every initial glance is revealed to be misdirected until our anti-hero, Skip McCoy, bursts onto the scene to meet the sultry gaze of Candy, the delivery girl who’s carting around a film strip which, unknown to her, contains U.S. government secrets that she’s passing on to a Communist agent. Fuller cuts between angular close-ups of Candy’s lustful visage and Skip’s stoic response, eventually revealing, through another extreme close-up, that he is picking her pocket, willing her closer to him so he can make off with the dough. An on-looker sees him, but the sea of bodies prevents him from making it off the train in time. And in one short minute, Fuller brilliantly sets up a world of mistrust, deception and fierce individuality – a world where former absolutes like love and honor all have their price.  Post-war malaise tinged with Cold War paranoia and the struggles of the enlightened yet suffering “modern man” are all efficiently packaged in this rough-edged, no-nonsense noir where the area’s always grey. Fuller’s anti-hero always remains incomplete, never fully aligning himself with either side. He is a perpetual tweener, not taken in by the nationalistic platitudes spouted his way left and right, yet willing to rough Candy up when he takes her for a Commie. And still he stands on no side but his own, remaining content as a lonely thief, since in that, at the very least, he can be honest about his deception. Not only does Skip initially refuse to turn the film over to the authorities, instead seeing if he can squeeze the Commies for 25 Grand, but even when he does the right thing – giving the squirmy Communist agent Joey his comeuppance, accepting Candy’s love as a sign of his own personal redemption, and even giving the police everything they need – he leaves not with thanks but the stamp of a two-bit crook and a clean wrap sheet that comes with a snide guarantee that it won’t stay that way for long. In Fuller’s world, there’s always an angle and trust is a commodity in short supply. The Reds are the bad guys, but no one leaves untainted and in the end, Candy, in her angelic white dress, is perhaps the only sign of hope and even that comes about through an uneasy mix of naivety and guts.",2,40,2,229,504,20/2/16,rated-10

The initial setup led me to believe I had this movie totally figured out; but I should’ve known Fuller would have far more up his sleeve. There’s a sequence in Pickup on South Street that I might rank up with the greatest of all time (if you’ve seen it—all I have to say is Thelma Ritter) that totally blindsided me with an intense emotional punch. I found myself nearly starting to full on cry, and by its end realized I hadn’t been breathing. Perfectly staged, performed, and executed. It was glorious. That scene alone bumps this up a whole half star. Thankfully the rest of it is also quite great.

This is my third Sam Fuller movie I've seen where he is director and definitely my favorite so far, though I've found stuff to like in all of his work. I talked at length in my Run of the Arrow review  about how much of that film is full of contradictions and Emmeline commented about how contradictions are basically a trademark of Fuller. I think in Run of the Arrow the contradictions made the film weaker, but the contradictions of Pickup only strengthen it. The biggest one I wanna focus on is the juxtaposition between the vilification of communism and how class and poverty are such central themes to the work. On one hand, the big bad of the entire film is communist agents sharing patent secrets, and there's a big point made about how terrible it is to be a traitor to America. On the other hand, Moe (a wonderful Thelma Ritter) gives an absolutely gorgeously acted monologue about the struggles of being poor, of wanting basic human respect but being forced to pay for it, of having to turn to crime just to get a marked grave. The most sympathetic characters are the ones committing petty crimes (like pickpocketing) and the film makes it clear these crimes are done out of necessity. It even criticizes how the justice system treats these poor characters, whose only option is crime, and how it demonizes them and is eager to put them in prison for life for repeating a nonviolent crime (this is personified by the police chief Tiger). Not only that, but Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark) doesn't even care about being a traitor! At the film's end it's unclear if the cops ever even got a hold of the secrets the communist spies were collecting, showing that though communism is a major piece of the story, in the grand scheme of things the film does not really care about Cold War conflict and instead cares about characters and the plights of those in poverty in the US. I also just have to mention Jean Peters. The entire main cast is wonderful (but honestly when are Ritter and Widmark ever bad?) but I haven't seen too much from Peters so far and was just blown away by how fantastic she was. I've only seen her in Niagara (she's good but it's not a showy role) and Viva Zapata (uhhhh...yikes) so I haven't gotten to see her in a thoughtfully written and well crafted role yet, which is exactly what Candy is, and Peters surpasses all expectations. She's stunning but also pulls off a wonderful balance between good girl and femme fatale. Not one to miss!

And so the race is on to find Skip with the authorities as well as the traitors equally desperate to find the thief. Adding to Skip's peril is the knowledge that as a three time loser, if the cops catch him again he's going to jail for the rest of his life, but even the promise to wipe the slate clean isn't enough for him, this is his one big chance and neither that promise nor appeals to his patriotism are going to divert him from his chosen course, which is to extract as much cash from the situation as possible. But while Skip is trying to get rich and Candy is falling (perhaps a little too quickly) for him, the other main player in this drama emerges, Thelma Ritters' Moe. Moe makes a living as an informer, describe a pickpocket's technique and she'll give you a list of men who fit the description. And apparently there's no animosity towards her, everyone's got to make a living and Skip's only concern is that she hasn't sold him short. But what makes Moe really fascinating is her one obsession, to make enough money to buy a burial plot and to have a proper funeral, her great fear is being buried in an unmarked grave Potter's Field. This is a woman who doesn't live to work or even work to live, she lives to die, she isn't worried about this life or the next, she's tired and possibly ailing and all that drives her on is reaching that goal. It may seem ridiculous for a character to be so obsessed with their death, but it's the one thing to live for, and how many of us can point to one reason why we keep on going? Once she gets enough money she'll be at peace, and how many of us will ever be able to say that?",7,9,1,417,"1,138",17-Feb-19,rated-8

The dialogue in Pickup On South Street is wonderful in different ways than I normally appreciate in a film noir. Here it's because it just sounds so wonderfully authentic, like they have made a genuine effort to make these people sound like they are a part of the criminal underworld. There are all kinds of wonderful phrases and slang used here, you could almost do a dictionary out of them. It also has the usual staples of these kinds of films, or certainly ones at their best, with some sparky suggestive dialogue between the always wonderful Richard Widmark and the smouldering and gorgeous Jean Peters. In fact, their relationship here is perhaps the biggest (and perhaps only) problem that I have with Samuel Fuller's film - the first of his that I have seen to date. Even by the standards of these films the whole build-up is completely unbelievable and there actually doesn't seem to be much chemistry between the two initially. But as the film progresses and Widmark begins to understand Peters a bit more, it becomes a lot more interesting and I really loved the way that Fuller mirrors his feelings for Peters in the way he also became protective of Thelma Ritter for not giving him up to the police. Also, having a criminal couple as the centre of such a film and actually setting up a happy ending for them was a different spin on things, I thought. In all other ways, Pickup On South Street is a superb example of the genre. Starting with a fantastic scene where Widmark pinches Peters' purse, this whole scene was the most interesting in the whole film. Does Peters actually know he's ripping her off? It later transpires that she doesn't but the way it's framed by Fuller immediately makes you suspect her as much as you do him. Peters really is excellent in this film. She even submits herself to taking what looks like quite a realistic pasting later on prior to being shot by Richard Kiley as he bumps her around their apartment for refusing to tell him where Widmark is. He's in his riverside shack, by the way, probably pulling up his box of beer from the river. It's a life's ambition of mine to live in a place where I can keep my Vimto cold in a nearby body of water rather than a fridge. Climaxing with a superbly vicious fist fight between Widmark and Kiley in a subway station as they punch each other's lights out, and a final scene that once again makes the cops in this seem like the bad guys, Pickup On South Street gets most of it spot on. My hero worship of Widmark continues unabated, especially as a result of any scene where he's winding up whatever detective is on his case this time. But Ritter is wonderful as a possibly terminally ill stool-pigeon / tie salesperson - she just wants to make enough money for a nice burial. It's good to have goals in life. This won't be my last Fuller, for sure. I did try Shock Corridor once but I turned it off after 15 minutes as it was doing my head in. Pickup On South Street never made me once even slightly inclined to stop watching.",8,36,4,469,"10,150",18-Jul-15,rated-8

Fuller was a tireless writer with a consistent voice across the media of film, television and literature, but synopsizing his zany stories won’t give you much sense of what it’s like to watch one. Several times in any given Fuller film, even the less good ones, I find myself remarking “Wow. he’s really doing that!? ” You can tell that Fuller’s most prominent fan Quentin Tarantino aspires to make his movies like this, but Fuller’s feel more natural. They are the reflection of an outrageous personality who just didn’t care about political correctness, loved strong oppositions and abetted his screenplays with visual creativity at any opportunity. Unlike most American directors, Fuller poured unguarded liberal politics, his opposition to communism and his hatred of racists into his films. But I suppose those of you who have only recently heard of Fuller are wondering where to start? He made a lot of movies across many genres. Fuller’s un-Hollywood-like convictions and intentions also meant he often worked with small budgets and less than top supporting talent. These B-movies can be jarring to modern viewers. Instead I suggest a Fuller newb start with Pickup on South Street from 1953. Pickup on South Street may not be the Fuller at his most outrageous (and we’ll get there pretty quick) but I it can lay claim not just to being Fuller’s best movie but one of the best American films ever made. It begins with a silent scene on a subway as a professional petty thief (Richard Widmark) demonstrates his pickpocketing technique on a passenger (Jean Peters) who turns out to be a hapless Communist agent. From this brilliant scenario unfolds a tale of of class struggle, cruelty, violence against women and espionage that moves through a fantasy of New York City’s underbelly. At only 80 minutes, there’s more going on here than in movies of twice that length. In most of Fuller’s movies we see how much a director with a plan can get out of actors who weren’t considered major talents or movie stars at the time. Fuller’s ability to create unique characters aided his films and the actors who played them in that way. Pickup on South Street has perhaps the best character and single best performance in all of Fuller’s filmography: legendary actress Thelma Ritter’s portrayal of dying snitch Moe Williams, for which she was nominated for an Oscar. One of the first things I noticed about Fuller was that, often as not, his movies pass the Bechdel Test. As he passed away before Alison Bechdel’s formulation I doubt he quite thought of it that way. Yet his movies shatter the conventional wisdom about why female characters are written the way they are. The scenarios in Fuller’s movies, if made by anyone else, call for one woman or none at all. But most of Fuller’s movies have several. In Pickup on South Street and others, these characters may speak to one another about their lives and not just about what the men are doing off-screen even when it’s more relevant to the story. Moe Williams is extraneous to the story in Pickup on South Street, or at least her role is far larger than a standard thriller plot in a short movie would require. Yet which would you choose, a movie with Moe or without? I think it's less about passing imaginary guidelines - Fuller was a personality too big for anyone else's schemes - and more about good writing that makes room for the inner lives of all kinds of characters.",5,11,0,254,"2,094",28-Jan-16,rated-10

Zanuck, who had Fuller under contract, tossed him a screenplay by Dwight Taylor called “Blaze of Glory”, Fuller persuaded him that he could seriously tweak the plot lines, did some research with an NYPD detective with experience of pickpockets, and came up with one of the classic noir screenplays. Zanuck and Fuller had to make some minor changes to the screenplay to get it past the Hayes Code, for its sex and violence, and J. Edgar Hoover, who considered it unpatriotic, but fortunately Zanuck stuck with Fuller.  In one of the extras on the Criterion Collection DVD, Fuller talks about his prime objective with all of his films, “Show it don’t tell it”, and that is very clearly on display here. The film opens in a crowded New York subway carriage where pickpocket Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), fresh out of jail for his third conviction, lifts the purse out of the handbag of Candy (Jean Peters), a B-girl trying to make good.  Candy, who is being tailed by the FBI, does not know that the envelope she is delivering for her ex-boyfriend, Joey (Richard Kiley), contains a microfilm that he is passing to his communist spy handlers.  As Joey, the communists, the FBI, the NYPD, and Candy are all after Skip and the microfilm, the key link is an old woman who is a known stool pigeon, Moe Williams (Thelma Ritter).  To add another layer of complexity, Candy also falls in love with Skip once she tracks him down. Apart from Skip’s disdain for the FBI when they try to play the loyalty card - Fuller changed Skip’s line from “Are you waving the goddamn flag at me” by removing the “goddamn” to placate Hoover - Hoover objected to the fact that the main three characters - Skip, Candy and Moe - were all negative characters on a good/bad binary.  While the dawning Skip/Candy romance might help to redeem them, Moe is by far the most interesting character in the film. When she gives Skip up to the NYPD, then sells his address to Candy, Skip refuses to condemn her, saying “She has to make a living”.  Moe has obviously had a hard life and her drive not to end up in a pauper’s grave is both funny and enormously sad.  At one point she says to the police captain: “Look, Tiger, if I was to be buried in Potter’s Field, it would just about kill me”. I was amazed to discover, in the DVD extras, that Fuller shot the entire film on the 20th Century lot in Los Angeles.  The subway carriage (rocked by Teamsters members), the subway tunnel in which the Skip/Joey fight happened, the dumb waiter in which Joey makes his escape, and Skip’s bait shack hideout on the Hudson, were all built in sound stages by Art Directors George Patrick and Lyle Wheeler and Set Decorator Al Orenbach.  My amazement was because the sets looked like the kind of neo-realism that Fuller so admired with the Italian neo-realists. Editor Nick DeMaggio also does great work.  The cuts in the opening scene moving back and forth between wide shots of the subway carriage, closeups of Skip pulling off the lifting of the purse, and reaction shots of the FBI and Candy is jaw-droppingly good. Cinematographer Joe MacDonald also does great work here too.  I loved the subway fight scene where he starts with a high shot of Skip and Joey then moves into a long take as the fight moves onto the platform then onto the tracks in the subway tunnel as a train moves through inches away from the pair. The final piece of the jigsaw is a great score by Leigh Harline with some really cool sax solos and a love theme for Candy and Skip contributed by an uncredited Lionel Newman.  I loved this film and was not surprised that Ritter garnered a Supporting Actress Oscar nomination and that Fuller won a Bronze Lion in Venice for their work here. There are some essential extras on the Criterion Collection DVD: a hugely entertaining video interview that film critic Richard Schickel conducted with Fuller in 2004; a fascinating edition of the French TV show, Cinéma Cinémas, in which Fuller does an audio commentary on the film’s opening scene; an on-screen illustrated biographical essay on Fuller; a stills gallery of photos, lobby cards and paintings; trailers for eight Fuller films; and a 20 page booklet containing excerpts from Fuller’s autobiography, including Martin Scorsese’s introduction, and an essay by cultural historian Luc Sante.",8,13,3,49,287,3-Sep-20,rated-9

None of the movies are wholly good, and not everything he made in the decade qualifies, but hooooo boy does Flatliners set the bar. Catholic shit everywhere, steam shooting out of every possible crevice, dozens of fill lights with the most melodramatic gels known to man. Schumacher's cinema is a great argument for the idea that the script is a pro forma pain in the ass that Hollywood requires as part of its terms of service (which is not a smart idea, but it's an idea), as his movies tend to have fairly diagrammatic scripts with characters that talk the plot along and take very by-the-book dramatic beats, while being filmed in an extremely ""if we don't use literally every resource we have access to it'll turn to dust"" aesthetic that, frankly, owns. Flatliners is a film about five young people who have great hair, and who all decide to do a thing because the movie needs them to do a thing. Kiefer Sutherland subsists on an all-scenery diet for the course of the film. Kevin Bacon has truly remarkable hair, even better hair than Julia Roberts, whose hair is subdued although her lipstick game is on a level your fav heterosexual director could never. Billy ""the other"" Baldwin has a Highly Problematic Relationship With Consent, and consequently has the worst hair in the movie. Oliver Platt has the best hair of his career but does not do the thing, which would be a criminal offense but his ""I'm Oliver Platt"" waiver absolves him. What ""do the thing"" refers to in that last bit is an act whose best cinematic exegesis was actually in Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, which Bill Hader's guitar tech character explains thusly: ""My favorite free time thing is flatlining. Flatlining is when you technically lower your heart rate until....um, well, you're dead. Then you can catch a glimpse of the afterlife. I got the idea from the film Flatliners, Joel Schumacher film, shot by Jan de Bont. You know, I try to fit in a F-line sesh at least once a week."" Unlike Hader, who is a perfect angel, the characters in Flatliners have all kinds of harrowing but extraordinarily easily resolved issues of guilt foregrounded in their minds after their F-line sesh. Not even their hair can save them. Until Joel Schumacher rides in on his alabaster steed, with steam shooting out of literally everything, and saves the day with some wildly over-caffeinated mise-en-scene. The point of all of this is that Flatliners would just be stupid bullshit relegated to the archives of pop cinema history if it didn't have the right director. With the right director, which this has, it's stupid highly rewatchable bullshit. Between this and his truly extraordinary Kidman iconography in the one Batman movie, Schumacher has an unassailable place in the canon. Not in, like, the main room, but on the grounds. Like I said on Twitter, ""The best movies are medical thrillers where they sledgehammer people in the solar plexus while bellowing at them to breathe,"" and there are like five scenes where that happens in Flatliners, so you do the math.",6,23,1,161,724,14/11/18,rated-6

It was as a movie that I’d heard so much about for thirty years, it just felt like I had seen it. Horror really seem to have been Joel Schumacher’s bailiwick. He and his crew create an extraordinarily creepy real world that can become ‘the other side’ at a moments notice, for the five principle actors to play in. The supernatural ritual of killing a person and counting how long they’ve been dead before reviving them, is extra creepy because it is based on the resuscitation science of the day.

This is ""St. Elmo's Funeral,"" as Kiefer Sutherland quipped for Fangoria — a star-studded cast of hot young actors trying to taste death and then spit it out, one by one, in a weird circle jerk of perverse hubristic peer pressure. The movie's absurd. That doesn't mean it's not good. But it doesn't mean it's good either. I enjoyed the rewatch and indulged in some grudging respect, honoring the departed. The script is a feint — only gestures at delving into the truly thrilling topics of death and the afterlife. Only gestures at creating characters and half-heartedly builds some very shaky journeys of judgment and redemption for them. I love the themes, I hate the thinness of the writing. But Schumacher racks up a cast of winners and ladles some heavy style over the whole thing. Production design (Eugenio Zanetti) and cinematography (Jan de Bont!) go nuts in the best way.

Despite the then-80/90s brat pack cast, Flatliners as a film, besides the flashback moments involving the students, doesn't go beyond the confines of the concept and plays things far too safe, thus, making the movie pedestrian and cookie-cutter like, when it ought to have been edgier, intriguing and menacing as a psychological thriller-horror type movie.  Set in Chicago, 5 medical students, led by Nelson, carry out a reckless experiment and have their internal organs, heart, lungs, brain, shut down for 2 or 3 minutes until they are revived. As the days go by, all of Nelson's friends take it in turns to volunteer being a human guinea pig and through their experiences, they hallucinate and envision images of things that they saw, whilst they were dead. I remembered a long time ago when I first saw this on TV as a teenager that I never took to this film and never liked it. & fortunately, rewatching it today, those feelings and memories still surface as before, although those feelings have slightly changed since. It revels in a state of arrogance that wallows underneath the teen-like aesthetic and self-pithiness and obnoxiousness of the characters it seeks to portray. Yet it also reminds me how utterly miscast Julia Roberts was in this movie. As much as I enjoy her other performances but for her rom-coms and that she oozes charisma, it was odd to see her in a movie such as this. As the lone girl Rachel, it was a far cry from Pretty Woman's Vivian, which came out in the same year, but it was also quite a change of direction for an actress who up until this point starred in fluffy, safe fare such as Steel Magnolias, Mystic Pizza and Pretty Woman. Interestingly, her appearance/starring role in Flatliners actually came before she blew up big time on Pretty Woman that same year but it's more of a support role, rather than one where her character, the only girl amongst the boys, her part doesn't give Julia much to do than to play the straight role in a dramatic psychological thriller.  & the least said about William Baldwin's Joe, the better. But then, what else do I expect from a director who did the awful Batman movies, minus Michael Keaton in the title role and the even more dirge-worthy Dying Young? Not much. Although Kevin Bacon as David was not bad, and he was by far my favourite: his performance easily outshines the others and compared to Julia Roberts, he was well cast. Although I did like the scenes with Bacon and Roberts's David and Rachel making banter with each other in one scene. Kiefer Sutherland, on the other hand, would have been more effective had his character had an air of personality. His scene with the bratty boy, Billy Mahoney where he gets the living daylights beaten out of him, Chucky the doll style, came out of the blue. The acting, on the whole, is fine, but I am questionable of some of the casting choices, but for Kevin Bacon who for me should have been the main lead, rather than Sutherland. The sex scene with Billy Baldwin was unnecessary and tacked on and I guess it's not just myself who thought it was strange to see a medical school operating out of a cathedral/museum.  Joel Schumacher is not a great director; his works have not impressed me but for Falling Down, and with production by Michael Douglas and here, Schumacher's style is very much centred on the youthful looks of Kiefer Sutherland, Billy Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon. He's more into the flashy side of things, but when it comes to substance and depth, he just doesn't go to greater lengths to extract that out of a movie. The Black and White flashback scenes are not so effective, the scenes with Billy Baldwin flatlining are boring, as a psychological thriller, it's not thrilling or scary enough and but for Kevin Bacon, it seems as though the rest of the main cast are just scraps. Since this film came out in 1990, out of the main five out of Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Billy Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Oliver Platt, it was indeed Roberts who went on to have a more sustainable Hollywood career as a rom-com actress, longevity-wise. Which is interesting to see, given I still believe and feel that Flatliners was not the ideal film for her.  Revisiting Flatliners, it's not so bad and terrible, but still, the casting choices and seeing Julia Roberts here is still strange, - although I have to admit that her performance wasn't so bad.  A psychological drama with a tinge of the horror-thriller, the young cast make the best out of a sub-par, somewhat lightweight script that chooses to stay within its confines, rather than go out of it and go out of the box and be more daring and risky. There was a remake or be it follow-up sequel to this film titled Flatliners that was released in 2017; I've not seen it, but from what I have read the general consensus is it is a needless movie. Overall, Flatliners is solid, but the limitations of the story and the fact that it didn't go far enough in terms of thrills and shocks are what weighs it down. Under Joel Schumacher, there is just no real sense of consequence or urgency and as much as it tries to echo its horror themes and tone, Flatliners lacked grit and the true element of fear, which would have propelled it further.  Schumacher underplayed this one, thus in doing so the film undermines any sense of realism and threat it chooses to pose and along with a less than impressive casting, but for Kevin Bacon, though it was watchable in places, with a much better cast and better characterisations, Flatliners would have made for a better movie.  It's not a must-see and I don't dislike it as much as I did back in the early 1990s, although it still is vague and feels banal and too pedestrian. That, and as a film, Flatliners under Joel Schumacher is far too safe. & flat.",15,9,2,535,702,17/12/17,rated-4

He always brought a flair, an energy, a pulpy, nitro, neon look  to each of his projects. They all stood out in some way, shape or form, they may not have always been amazing but they were interesting and highly entertaining to watch. A Time to Kill, The Lost boys, The Client, Falling Down.. each picture was rich in colour or an absorbing tone and narrative as if they were straight out of a comic book. With A Time to kill, we were drenched in a sweaty, sizzling, Southern setting filled with hate, justice and vengeance. With The Lost Boys, we plundered into a psychedelic, rock and roll infused Gothic nightmare that made us soar over the California coast. Finally, Flatliners(which I just watched for the first time) thrust us into a world brimming with the possibilities and questions that surround life and death, it's deeply spiritual, silently operatic and hauntingly tense.And that's the beauty of Schumacher, no matter what happened with any of his work, they were never boring, he always trusted the audience, always wanted them to question their own lives and the wonders that surround them. Also, apart from one or two missteps, he always delivered when it came to casting unknown actors.Rip dude, i'll try find some foggy alleyways or bridges to walk through in your honor.",1,6,0,879,554,28/6/20,rated-6

I thought the chapel was meant to be ironic or spiteful, but i think its a freudian act of safety. a glancing sugared whisper for protection from what may come, and a possible guarantee of being trapped in a place of worship in the afterlife for a sin, each persons suicide, that grants almost an Disney Express Pass into hell. also never fully appreciated how absolutely amazing this looks thanks to Jan De Bont (surprise). rust graded with lots of vent steam and fluo strip lights. exposed brick works and the grandiose rivet patterns of a steel bridge. the first time Nelson sees the dog and the street goes dark, exposing those huge blacklit demon faces on walls is like watching some wild bit of a stage show. the red hot/whiteblue cold of the thermo blanket and all the cabling of that medical equipment right next to dust sheets, scaffolding and huge statue heads might aswell make the film be watched inside a massive overlay of the word ""DRAMATIC"".

Flatliners is one of those films, actually. The only reason why I went out to watch this film was due to the remake (which I had no real interest in seeing) coming out, and I wanted to see its original source. Glad I did cause I was able to see Schumacher actually make a good film for once. The film is about a bunch of college kids led by Keifer Sutherland, Julia Roberts, and Kevin Bacon who want to venture out into the world beyond deaf in a daring science experiment that takes them out of life for just minutes. What starts out heavenly for these people become a living Hell when figments from their not-so-pleasant past come back to haunt them out of their minds, and they mean business. Flatliners does a good job at crafting an entertaining tale about death and the afterlife but also showcasing the horrors of experimenting with things you can't control. It also does a good job at getting you invested with characters that aren't really the most likeable at first (especially Sutherland), but the more the film progresses and their weaknesses are explored, that's when the film hits the mark of providing surprising emotional weight, which helps when you've got someone like James Newton Howard providing an underrated score that's downright haunting in places.  So yeah, Joel Schumacher made a good film, one that successfully dives deep into supernatural horror and keeps things going at a reasonable pace. Some of the directing is a little odd in places, and one of the characters doesn't not have an emotional climax like the rest of the characters (but then again, he was the weakest character anyway, so it doesn't matter that much), but in the end, the most important thing about Flatliners is that Joel Schumacher has solid directing chops and could make a comeback if he ever wanted to. Maybe he should have directed the semi-sequel/remake released this weekend...  74/100",7,15,0,268,"1,035",29-Sep-17,rated-8

And I liked it, maybe more than I expected to. It looks absolutely fantastic. Jan de Bont sure does some work here. The set design and lighting make this look like one long music video from the early 1990’s. In fact, this is probably the most early 1990’s looking movie I can think of. And there is no way I’m not going to like that. The set designs are actually distracting because so many of them are completely inappropriate for the scenes and characters. Why are the medical students dissecting human bodies in what looks like an old gothic church? Why does Kiefer Sutherland’s apartment look like an art exhibition? But as insane as it, it looked great, so I didn’t care. It is a little drawn out and gets a bit repetitive. I couldn’t help but feel that it would have been better if three characters instead of four were being haunted – four just felt like too much towards the end. Especially since Sutherland’s story and Kevin Bacon’s story are so similar. And I didn’t understand the ‘healing’ in the final scene with Sutherland. That just seemed to happen because it needed to happen to wrap up the story. And Bacon screaming at god about stepping on his territory is as on the nose as it sounds. But I like the cast and they’re all fun in this. And the concept is great.",6,5,0,459,485,25-Oct-17,rated-8

Joel Schumachers Flatliners is like David Cronenberg lite in that it either overthinks or underthinks its exciting but implausible concept of taking your consciousness to the afterlife and returning to tell the story. In typical Schumacher fashion, this grandstanding failure is marked by the presence of a damn good showman.  Even so, Flatliners eventually turns into a shoddy ghost story about making peace with angry spirits (some that are still alive?) in an attempt at ruminating over the idea that we carry our transgressions with us into the grave. The realm of death couldve been an interestingly conceived world ala Altered States Ken Russell type dimension/plane hopping but instead they treat the idea like a Lifetime made for tv movie would. Only William Baldwins character sees a version of the afterlife that suits the atmosphere of the film well; a dark, vaguely erotic experience that is indistinguishable from pleasure or pain.  Or maybe he was just trapped inside the movie Hellraiser... Story and execution are not what makes Flatliners a good film, though. Its all about that grimy 90's aesthetic and set design accompanied with a great gothy church choir score by James Newton Howard to make the film an aural and visual experience above all else. I think in a way Joel was trying to portray our real world as the nightmarish one filled with judgement and sin. The afterlife, if youre a good person, is paradise. Not exactly groundbreaking thoughts but again, this is a film meant to be absorbed as a whole. Schumacher just guides your feelings and emotions like a creepy voyeuristic maestro behind the curtain.  Now that I think about it, I dont really hear a lot of praise for Joel Schumacher from the vulgar auteurism crowd but he seems like a special kind of schlock director that they would appreciate.

On the page, this deeply spiritual, quasi-religious, Jungian exploration of the subconscious shadow among five medical students could have been kinda dry and cheesy (aside from the whole dying for thrills part), but NO.  First of all, Joel Schumacher hired my boy Jan de Bont to shoot the absolute ever-loving shit out of this thing, every dang shot just billowing so much fog, misty neon, low angle tracking shots, Dutch angles out the ASS.  THEN, he gets Eugenio Zanetti to production design this movie into some kind of gothically operatic giallo ""The Exorcist,"" so that these absolutely deranged medical students are flatlining themselves in what looks like an abandoned basilica filled with plastic sheeting and sparking wiring and a giant random Greek statue head, and operating on cadavers in a centuries old cathedral.  THIRDLY, Joel had Mali Finn cast Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Billy Baldwin and Oliver Platt at the PEAK of their powers and beauty. Best Kiefer performance?  The best example of how the direction takes the writing to a whole new level is an early scene where Kevin Bacon is quitting medical school. It's a pretty straightforward conversation, where Kiefer tries to get him to stay to do their experiment that night. But for no reason that I could discern, Kevin Bacon exits his room via a rope dangling out a window, rappelling down a wall, and then gets into his vehicle, which is an army surplus truck with a canvas cover over the truck bed. Where does one even get one of those? Are they in Eastern Europe? The whole scene is just baffling but delightful and gives it that extra edge. There are all these basic scenes in this movie but just because of the setting/shooting/mise-en-scene it instantly makes them that much more fascinating (I also like the bodega and diner scenes for this reason). The themes are a little much and at the end there it gets a bit too woo-y, but because of my *personal shadow work* I totally go for that kinda thing. How fun.",8,18,1,84,"1,159",22-Jun-20,rated-9

What happens minutes after death? With Kiefer Sutherland's Nelson as the leader, five medical students went through a dangerous experiment of playing God. There are some inconsistencies regarding the medical aspect of the film but I like how the characters are intent on selling the story. The experiences they had after death were also acceptable, nothing too ridiculous or silly. They tried to one up one another and the true horror started when they realized they had carried back with them some kind of dark, unresolved guilt from each of their past.  As the movie falls into a pattern of them going under and getting revived, the plot started to drag, it feels too long at 115 minutes, and the cop out ending didn't help either. But in conclusion, the film is worth checking out, it is interesting enough and is undeniably good looking with all its neon colors, and shadows, and stained glass windows.",1,5,0,400,387,20-Sep-17,rated-6

Set in a medical school where a student named Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland) gets the crazy idea to “flatline” aka kill himself and bring himself back to see what the afterlife was like, the film explores his efforts and those of his friends. Joined by Rachel (Julia Roberts), Dave (Kevin Bacon), Joe (William Baldwin), and Randy (Oliver Platt), Nelson and the group kill themselves for increasingly longer periods of time to establish what happens depending on how long one is dead. The results are horrifying. Hunted down by hallucinations, the group quickly begin to regret their experiment and must seek a way to fight against these hallucinations. A fun little schlocky early 1990s film, Flatliners is pure camp but with a great hook and largely solid execution. The cast is game, playing right into the cocky assuredness of these smart-but-reckless medical students. Even Schumacher’s direction is solid, showing considerable control of a plot that could have gone right into pure cinematic insanity but never does. So, why does the film fall short? It is just too safe in the end. It is too neat, too pretty, and too dull. Even as the film begins to show the hallucinations, it largely works. Schumacher creates an eerie atmosphere, setting much of the action in dark hallways or under train tracks, creating a truly chilling setting for the horrors that unfold with sinister music often pulsating in the background. Even the scenes of them dying are met with this same creepy production and sound design as they lay out on a gurney in the middle of an empty room with all of the lights off. Dark, ominous, and surrounded by the seemingly religious objects, this sinister concoction of Nelson’s mind begins to manifest itself into horrifying hallucinations. At first, the group keeps these hallucinations to themselves before eventually caving and sharing their experiences thus far. In the scenes of the hallucinations, as previously mentioned, Schumacher delivers great tension and horror as we try to piece together what exactly is happening to the minds of these young students. Other than these hallucinations, they are normal with no lasting effects. What does this say about the afterlife and the belief that it is all sunshine and roses once we die? The film manages to raise these excellent questions, setting up quite the compelling ending. Schumacher’s consistent inclusion of religious imagery and the spiritual battle going on certainly feels akin to Frankenstein as these young medical students play with death and resurrect the dead in the name of science. The film clearly positions these kids as playing God to some degree as they toy with this, even ending the film with an image of God. Images of crosses, even in reflections, are not uncommon for this film. There is even discussion amongst the group about the afterlife, Dave’s atheism, and Rachel’s held belief that death is a beautiful thing with the afterlife ready to lift one up like a pillow in a comfortable bed. This consistent referencing and imagery positions the audience in a place where we come to believe that the film is intended to have some spiritual themes and significance. This is a film for Schumacher, like in Frankenstein, to explore the morals and the spiritual implications of toying with death. Though what these students are doing does have some scientific purpose and significance, there is clearly a line that is being crossed that is not meant to be crossed. Even the film’s descent into psychological horror and hallucinations hints at this as Schumacher positions it as a punishment of sorts for what these students have done in this experiment and in their life up until this point. Thus, when the film settles into its relatively small-scale result, it is hard not to feel disappointed. It is this film where these kids play with death and play God. Schumacher has included all of this religious imagery to this point and, hell, even the hallucinations are the students’ old sins coming back to get even. It is guaranteed to be a horrifying finale, right? No. Instead, we get scenes of Dave driving out into the country to make amends with the girl he bullied. Joe does nothing other than get outed as a pig. Rachel hugs her dead father as he injects heroin (how the hell is that her sin anyways? She did nothing). Nelson sends him back under again to meet the boy he killed. This dull reveal and turn taken the film is greatly disappointing. Not only is some of the horror beforehand - like Rachel’s father popping up in a cadaver - predictable but this ending is so tepid, safe, and dull, that it is impossible to endorse and enjoy in the campy way the film begins as. Instead, it takes a solemn and risk-averse ending with all of the characters given their happy ending, freedom from their sins, and forgiveness. I have no issue with the film’s campy premise or goofy effects or implausibility. Instead, the problem with Flatliners is that it sets up this truly horrifying Frankenstein-esque finale with tons of religious imagery only to then let all of the characters off the hook for what they have done before and now (again, Rachel did not even do anything, her sin is impeccably lazy compared to the others). It is a mushy, sentimental, and exceedingly dull finale that may have a solid climax as they try to bring Nelson back, but the film’s predictability as it unfolds robs the scene of any suspense. Instead, it just drags on and on as the audience begs for Nelson to just start breathing again like we all expect. The film even has the fake-out death that all horror films seem to have as it pretends Nelson is dead until one last ditch effort by Dave miraculously brings him back. It is nonsensical, dull, predictable, and appallingly safe. It is like Schumacher is willing to set all of them up as egotistical antiheroes who play God, but is too afraid to damn them in the way he thinks they should be damned. This is a crushingly disappointing finale given how enjoyable the film is up to this point. A thrillingly enjoyable campy science fiction film, Joel Schumacher’s Flatliners fizzles into safety and dullness by the end, but before that, it really hums along. It is a film that is played straight while remaining acutely aware of how insane it all is, which makes it a very fun watch in the end. For light entertainment, one can watch far worse than Flatliners. However, it is through-and-through a standard Hollywood film, except it has a unique concept that really hooks you in and keeps you engaged until the very end.",5,15,0,894,"1,998",12-Nov-17,rated-6

I was consistently bored through the first two acts, and the characters were pretty flat. It picks up in the final act, and the characters are given more development, but by then it was a bit too late. It's not necessarily a bad movie, but I'm not going to say I thought it was good either, as it is littered with medical inaccuracies, which as the son of a nurse annoyed me. It also has a cop-out of an ending that left a sour taste in my mouth. As a whole, Flatliners is just a really mediocre mess, but it's not awful by any means.GRADE: C+",1,5,0,200,800,13-Sep-17,rated-5

I've had appreciation for his films in the past, but this is the first film where his unique style clicked with me. Everything in this film is expressionistic, from the lighting and production design to the acting, dialogue, wardrobes and makeup. These aren't real people in real locations doing real things--they are objets d'art in a mad puppeteer's midway marionette show. Schumacher's world is one where the boundaries between waking life and dreams are wavy, where people see what they want to see. A perfect match for a film about dissolving the line between life and death. The same can be said for the themes and style of The Number 23, but the ideas in that film weren't as intriguing so it didn't click for me like this one did. And I've never been a big Julia Roberts admirer, but damned if she isn't easy on the eyes here. Those producers in the '90s knew what they were doing, handing the Batman franchise over to someone with such a singular vision. We the audiences just didn't know what we had.

Are they hallucinating or are they seeing ghosts? Joel Shumacher’s medical thriller tells an interesting enough story, with a good cast, and the script thankfully remains smart enough to care about plausibility. At some points it teases with an answer to the question above, and it could easily have decided to sit on the wrong side of that “or” question (for me) and come across as dumb. But it didn’t, and came off as moderately intriguing. What I really didn’t like about this film, though, is the overwrought production design and lighting (which would more fittingly get recycled in Batman Forever) at the service of a story that didn’t require a gothic world to be built for it. The seemingly eternal penumbra, constantly swaying light sources, and weird oversized statues in the wrong place are just way too much. Would have loved to have this story set in plain real world, with special lighting kicking in during the death and hallucination sequences. On the other hand, James Newton Howard’s themes are appropriately haunting.",1,5,0,486,464,18-May-17,rated-6

I admit to enjoying the idea of a group of characters striving to unlock the secrets of the afterlife by reproducing near-death experiences. That’s an interesting seed of a story. Unfortunately, the way the film gets there undermines the concept.  It’s Joel Schumacher’s vivid, opulent stylings that catapult the film into being something more.

She seeks a home she cannot seem to find in Sacramento and when she finally makes it to New York she realizes that she brought it with her across the country, she cannot deny her true home no matter how far she goes.  I cannot speak for anyone else, but I found this film so moving because It is the story I am living right now, it is the story of my middle class family, my worried mother, my depressed father, my small town roots, my own desire for something greater, and the damage that ambition can bring.  All the things that the character Lady Bird is chasing are the same things I have been searching for myself, and that search led me to the first ever screening of this film on top of a mountain in Colorado with these extraordinary filmmakers. At this moment I'm not sure what to make of it, but it does not feel like chance.",7,256,7,236,285,1-Sep-17,rated-9

She doesn’t know how to help you and it frustrates her.” I’ve grown and changed so much since I last saw this, but I’m so grateful that my mom is still a constant in my life no matter how much we brawl with each other. We are both very complicated and strong-willed people, but god, no one understands me like she does and nobody ever will.  The thing that kills me about this movie is Greta’s attention to detail in every little interaction between Marion and Christine, even the seemingly random parts like the model home tours (something I never realized anyone but me and my own mom did for fun). I think a few years of distance have made me understand Marion a little more, specifically her own struggles which she hides from Christine and the frustration and guilt that bubbles under the surface because she both does and doesn’t want Christine to ask about them. Christine is right when she says that the reason her mom is tough on her is because she cares about her so much, but for that same reason, every minor tussle hurts so much more. In August, I am moving to NYC. It’s something I’ve (possibly very naively and/or stupidly) dreamed about since I was 9 years old because even then, I hated Florida and wanted nothing more than to get out. This sentiment continued through my middle school, high school, and college years, growing exponentially until things finally came into focus for me about a month ago. It’s not that I don’t want to go. I do. But it’s like that quote from The Last Black Man in San Francisco: you don’t get to hate it (in my case: Orlando) unless you love it, and looking back, I was just so damn resentful all the time. I said I hated my town and, in the beginning, I said I hated the college I went to because it wasn’t one of the “new england liberal arts colleges” that I drooled over but couldn’t afford to go to. To this day, I don’t really know why I acted like that. I leave Gainesville on Saturday and I only have a few more nights left with my remaining roommate/one of my best friends in the apartment we’ve shared for three years. I feel like a part of me is dying and I’m already in mourning. I start packing tomorrow, and even with boxes scattered across the floor, I know I could still walk from one end of the apartment to the other with my eyes closed and not trip over anything (and I’m a really clumsy person so that’s saying something). It’s comforting to know somewhere that intimately. I kind of feel the same way about both of these Florida cities I’ve lived in. I could drive from one familiar haunt to the next in my mind without leaving my bed, and that same familiarity that has suffocated me for so many years feels more like the tattered remains of a security blanket lately, or perhaps the last shreds of my adolescence. I hate Florida, but I’ll miss it. I love my friends that I’ve made and all of the stupid, messy memories we share and the language we’ve invented that’s entirely our own. I love my dad and his gentle soul and attempts to make me smile even on my worst days. And I love my mom, the most strong, selfless, fascinating, and loving woman I have ever known, or rather, who I’m still just starting to get to know. I’m so scared for my own phone call moment, which I know is going to come eventually even though I’ve been pretending it won’t. But I’m mostly filled with hope. I’m subsisting on hope. And I’m so glad that revisiting this film when I did could reawaken that feeling and envelope me in its sincerity and tenderness. I really, really needed it. “But I wanted to tell you. I love you. Thank you, I’m... thank you.”",5,155,6,382,"5,019",9-Apr-20,rated-9

We both stared at them for a long time; my mom quietly prayed for her wish to come true, her voice carrying a quiet yearning as she tossed it into the fountain. I took a bit more time, closing my eyes and doing my best to focus on what I truly wished for. I kissed the penny, and let it go in the water. That moment made me realize how much my mother and I have been through together. Shes the strongest person I know.  So this was as expected, a very emotional film for the both of us. Certain habits Lady Bird carries that angers her mother (using two towels for the bathroom, something I do) seemed like moments directly lifted from my life. We looked over at each other multiple times and just laughed at the coincidences. We bonded over how much of ourselves we saw in these characters. It felt like a gift. Experiences as beautiful, insightful, and honest as Lady Bird are few and far between. Greta Gerwig displays a directoral skill that is mind blowing for a debut. She has such love for the free spirited era of being young and passionate about something. She's not only proved herself as a legendary screen presence and writer, but now as a director. There's no doubt in my mind come Academy time, I would love to see her on stage accepting every award under the sun. I've been feeling old recently at 21, but for an hour and a half, this let my mom and I feel young again. This was needed. Thank you for this.",5,472,11,317,"9,917",18-Nov-17,rated-10

So delightful. So moving. So real. I love the sense of omniscience Greta Gerwig always uses in framing her characters; we don’t only see through the protagonist’s eyes, but we get to see the inner lives and struggles and intimacies of all the supporting characters, too...even when Lady Bird isn’t paying attention. Julie stays behind and lovingly rubs her name on the cast list sheet. Marion stops to take one last look at the kitchen window in her dream house. Larry watches his daughter get out of the car and waits before driving off. Greta often depicts her characters alone, observing their eyes in those little moments when nobody else is watching, which is something only cinema could ever do. The specificities and idiosyncrasies of Lady Bird and Little Women and even Frances Ha are what make their worlds feel real and human and beautiful. It’s fundamentally empathetic work.",2,180,4,96,"5,483",21-Feb-20,rated-9

There is no disappointment in this film. This is something good, something really really good. It's a simple premise, something so many teenagers who are living through it and grown ups who have lived through it can relate to. Sometimes it's good to have a film, a story, that isn't hard to understand. We can reach to the ends of our minds and pull out the most convoluted and revolutionary ideas to make movies out of, or to write books about in order to feel like we're doing something new. But sometimes a film doesn't need to be far away from reality to amaze us. Sometimes covering the visceral parts of our lives can give us the same shock, anticipation, emotion. Subjects like school, sex, family, friendship. They're so obviously close to everyone that we forget to talk about them sometimes. A lot of the time I don't like to think about school, university, the shocking lack of friends I have, my relationship with my mum. And I try to tell myself it doesn't matter, we're floating on a rock in space and we eat stuff like peanut butter and time isn't real and literally nothing matters, you don't need to get into university to live, the oxygen will still be there after you read the rejection letter. I could spend hours, days, years trying to distance myself from reality and thinking about my responsibilities because it's all just much too overwhelming. But sometimes, a film like this brings me back down to Earth. And I'm not mad about it. I'm glad this film reminded me of my own situation, I'm glad that halfway through I thought ""oh fuck I need to make that digital portfolio don't I?"" I'm glad it made me think about the time I've been having with college, the crying, the stress, the small dance parties in my auntie's cafe as we ignore all the filming we have to do, the laughing at my friend trying to make a sandwich because he literally plays a sandwich shop employee but can't make a sandwich to save his life (casting choices were limited). I am so so grateful for how this movie reminded me of myself. I am grateful for the parts I could relate to, the parts I couldn't, the parts that may come in my future. I think this movie will stay this way for a long time, there are parts of it that will relate to people forever, no matter how we change in the future, even if we do get floating cars and shit. This movie will make me feel this way for a while, I'm almost sure of it. To me, this movie deserves all the praise it has gotten, is getting and will get.",1,111,9,513,"4,527",26-Dec-17,rated-10

It's one of those well-made films that has nothing glaringly wrong with it and is impossible to hate because of the palpable passion behind the camera. However, it's also one of those films that seems to get its mileage out of how much the audience connects with it, and any connection to it for me is on a smaller and more transient level. There are little moments throughout that are stunningly beautiful in their simplicity--a few pieces of paper late in the film hold a tremendous amount of power--but Gerwig's slice of life approach doesn't always translate to meaningful depth for every character and dynamic. I'm left marveling at a few select sequences and appreciating Gerwig's grounded approach, but I'm also left wondering ""Is that it?"" as the credits roll. Clearly the approach here is true to real life, and perhaps the hype influenced my slightly underwhelmed reaction, but the film overall doesn't quite have that element that pushes its collective whole into ""great"" territory. It's solid but not special. And you know, that's perfectly fine. In and of itself, the one truly great element is the relationship between Lady Bird and her mother. Ronan and Metcalf are both fantastic here, and it's within their scenes where Gerwig's vision truly crystallizes. The mother-daughter dynamic encompasses all the messiness of life, the push and pull of what's in front of you and what's behind you. The single most important theme of the film is arguably contradiction, precisely because life is about the contradictions that allow you to learn and grow and hate people and love people. Contradictions are a part of growing up, maybe taking the form of a hometown you can't help but feel connected to or a future you can't help but long for. And maybe you're sick of certain people but you really do love them but you don't express that in the best of ways. And maybe you're arguing with someone and then you see a dress you both like and then everything is okay for just a moment. And maybe you're just changing, and you have no idea who you're going to be and ""I don't know"" is the prevailing question in your life. In the end, you live and thrive in those contradictions, and raising someone you love can become something joyously grueling. Being raised by someone you love can be beautifully frustrating. On a surface level, raising a child is ultimately a transitional and biological mechanism of life, but there's something very meaningful to be said about those formative years. And all of it can be glimpsed in the tiny frailty of a rearview mirror, captured in the most fleeting of glances but tinged with the endurance of hope and love. B (note: I upped this to 4/B+ on second viewing, as I liked it significantly more. Perhaps I'll write another review someday) -Tracy Letts was basically ignored during the Q&A and I demand a redo.",4,409,24,511,"4,303",6-Nov-17,rated-7

But the real conflict in Lady Bird isn’t one of money, per sé. It’s the idea that dreams, and the future, are by definition beyond reach. And sometimes beyond our means. The pain, which is also the joy, of Lady Bird is that its characters confront this over and over. It’s built into the movie’s bones. Gerwig makes us fly through the movie, packing an entire TV season’s worth of material into under two hours, such that Lady Bird’s aspirations are frequently thrown into conflict with her circumstances. It’s energizing: the movie achieves liftoff and never looks back. Gerwig’s direction—her sense of movement, performance, detail, comic timing—is intimidatingly nimble. But nothing is more humbling than her boundless imaginative sympathy, and her ability to translate that feeling to the screen with such joy. But will I ever forgive the movie for getting Dave Matthews Band’s “Crash Into Me” re-stuck in my head after so many years of denial over my love for that song, or for reminding me, in a very pointed way, of what it was like to feel like a failure and a dweeb in high school who just wanted to escape?

""I don't know any other way to say it other than none of it actually happened, but it's all true."" Listening to Beanie talk about how much she looks up to Saoirse and how they truly fell in love as best friends while playing Julie and lady bird made me so happy. even listening to Timothée talk about how Greta gave him so much literature to read to prepare him for his role of Kyle who has such a minor part shows she wanted absolutely everything to be perfect. ""The more real it is, the more people will find things that are special about it, so don't think you're messing anything up, I want you like who you are and that's why you're here."" Watching Greta tear up behind the camera while they're filming a scene and just stare in awe really makes me realize how much heart and soul she put into Lady Bird and how much this movie means to her.

Lady Bird is coming-of-age film about a seventeen year old teenager, her tumultuous relationship with her mother and her treacherous self-exploration in the last year of high school. Coming-of-age is a genre that is close to my heart, as a previous teenager myself, and this film captivated me when I first watched it back in 2018, as I saw myself in Lady Bird herself. I’ve had a not-so-great relationship with my mother when she was alive and my high school is nothing but hell, but looking back at the memories made me think that I took that time for granted—that I felt like I didn’t explore and express myself enough—and it’s really upsetting. Gerwig manages to resonate with her target audience by inserting a scenario or two where anyone can connect with, and it’s this connection that makes it too personal, to the point where every scene linger in your mind for days, weeks, months, or even years, in my case. The centerpiece of all of this is the incredibly dynamic relationship of a mother and daughter and the film managed to show that not everything is what it seemed to be and showcased the difficulty of being a teenager and a parent in this day and age. The complexities of human connection and familial relationships was perfectly portrayed by the film and its bittersweet dramedy aspect will definitely force you to remember your adolescent years, whether it be good or bad.  See also:Allain’s Top 100 — CLICK HERELetterboxd Popular 250 — CLICK HERE21st Century Best Picture Nominees — CLICK HERENovember 2020 Watches — CLICK HERERecommend Me a Film — CLICK HERE",2,201,21,464,"3,107",3-Nov-20,rated-10

You think you know better than everyone else. (You don't.) You think every decision you make will impact your life forever. (It won't.) As much as the character of Lady Bird outwardly presents herself as unique, she's just like every other eighteen-year-old inside.  Lady Bird will take you right back to being on that fragile cusp of adulthood. I'm in that headspace while writing this. Which is why I'm about to make this review about me, like any eighteen-year-old would. This isn't really a true critique since the film itself is so damn good, and this may come off as selfish, but I am definitely craving a mainstream coming-of-age film that is about .... um ..... non-white girlhood. Obviously it's semi-autobiographical about Greta Gerwig's own coming-of-age, and she totally deserves to tell her own personal story. White Catholicism is just such a different culture than what I'm used to, but I do think it's so important that white Catholic girls get to have this movie and I don't want to detract from that! Also, Lady Bird can totally be read as intersectional due to its focus on a lower-class family, another identity that is too often underrepresented and misrepresented in film.  I could still vigorously relate to the character of Lady Bird. I too did theater and had a high school boyfriend who was THE theater star. I too had a brief fling with a pretentious boy in a band who treated me like garbage and wouldn't go to prom with me. I too would do silly things just to maintain my ~quirky~ image. I too was intelligent but had less-than-stellar grades because high school wasn't an environment that I could comfortably learn in. This story is one of the few that can transcend identity politics and become universal.  Honestly, I suppose I'm just jealous, but I do wish that there was an Asian or Mixed-Race Greta Gerwig who could tell my coming-of-age story with such tact, such wit, such honesty and candidness. Guess it's up to me to write it! PS.

So, turn down the lights, crank down the volume, and schedule an appointment with your local priest because Alucarda is sure to pollute your soul on a fundamental level.

The first time I watched it, I remarked that a lot of films promise something and don't deliver, but Alucarda delivers everything you could ever ask for. If you're a fan of Satanic horror at least. Tina Romero gives a startling performance as a teenage girl who's grown up in a bizarre rural convent where the nuns all wear bloodied bandages. When ingénue Justine (Susana Kamini) arrives as a novice, Alucarda falls obsessively in love. Their lesbian fling unleashes... Hell? Of some description. I mean, this movie is just wall-to-wall hysteria. As soon as it kicks off, the screaming starts and doesn't let up. There's goat masks, Pan-like hunchbacks, copious full frontal nudity, crucifixions, nuns on fire, blood sucking, the list goes on. It just keeps delivering scene after scene of gleefully Satanic madness. Picture The Rape Of Christ sequence from The Devils. Then make a whole film out of it and you've got Alucarda. There is some genuine talent behind all this madness though. It's beautifully filmed, the set decoration is visionary and there's a palpable rage towards the Catholic church running through it that, even at the film's melodramatic heights, lends it depth. Arguably, there are things lifted from other, more popular religious horror films of the time but this distills them into something new. Rather than expressing the malevolence of the occult, Alucarda presents it as something cathartic and ecstatic. It's highly theatrical and almost plays like a dance rather than a film. Sure, it will offend most viewers, one way or another, but will utterly enthrall the remaining few.",4,9,1,155,599,19-Sep-18,rated-10

Running just a little under 80 minutes, its biggest enemy is perhaps its own slightness, but its commitment to the cinema of hysteria ensures that it hardly ever feels truly weightless. Quite the contrary, it's a truly wild ride if there ever was one; lots of blood, lots of screaming, mummy-wrapped nuns, Satanic worship, and beautifully macabre imagery. It could have benefited from a deeper exploration of its themes but I think it's important to acknowledge that the purpose of the film seems to be rebellion. I don't think the images have lost any of their power over time, and the costumes remain a bizarre treat; they're all so perfectly grounded in what perhaps feels most comfortably like some kind of absurdist horror-theater.

Has about an hour and fifteen minutes to tackle spirituality, repression, organized religion, sexuality, authoritarianism etc in a visceral, extreme way and kind of overachieves it. It's definitely very, very rough around the edges but when this movie sticks the landing on its ambitious concepts it's genuinely exhilarating. Loved just about everything going on visually, from the costume design, set design, and the low-rent special effects. Considering their resources the cinematography is very impressive, and the final scenes in the movie are dominated by hellish, occasionally powerful imagery. The major setpieces like the chapel on fire are particularly excellent and the costumes are great too, especially the nuns who all look like blood-soaked mummies. The costumes in general reveal a lot about certain characters and it makes up for the movie's lack of engaging dialogue. Alucarda wears pure black the entire movie and she looks cool as hell. Actually, most of this movie looks cool as hell. I wasn't aware that the copy I had was an English dub but the dialogue sounded a little muffled so I ended up experiencing the entire movie on headphones. Some of the wild sound cues are horrendous but works in its favor--it takes this sudden jump in intensity and some of these noises are so strange and jarring that it's pretty fucking scary! I don't remember much about the score besides some weird keyboard warbles. Eventually the soundtrack becomes dominated by nonstop hysterial nun screaming that would be especially annoying if they weren't some of the most blood curdling Horror screams ever recorded.  As mentioned the dialogue is nothing to write home about but the movie is very well performed and features melodramatic overacting particularly from Tina Romero that reminded me a lot of Isabelle Adjani's fully committed hysterics in Possession. It's also got some serious pacing issues, mainly that it's way too short and it starts to move at a breakneck pace towards a payoff that--while remaining utterly, consistently batshit--feels a bit flat.

Alucarda is draped in funerary black, while Justina and the other girls are more colorful. The doctor is also an imposing, gaunt blackclad figure. He is serious and somber, unlike the strange Roma-caricatures (in greens and other bright colors, typically). It's easy coding for the most part, but the nuns especially stand out. Those costumes suggest so much, from their medical allusions to their distinct evocation of femininity and the mixed symbolism of menses--blessing or curse, female empowerment or fertility, depending on who is reading or writing it. Then there's the set design. The most notable ones are the tomb, the cavern, the chapel, and the doctor's house. The tomb is almost barn-like, calling back to the birthplace of Alucarda (born in a stable), but with a cobwebbed mustiness typical of graves in horror films. It also evokes, of course, Dracula's castle and other vampiric resting places, of course. The cavern, which I have no better name for, is a cave-like part of the convent that is so incongruous with the fact that it's a convent that I really don't know what to say about it. It's just strange and striking. The chapel, also in a cavernous part of the convent, features a massive alter of candles and a huge statue of the crucifixion, which are central to the best shot in the film--a girl, stretched out on the altar, surrounded by lit candles, the savior hanging in shadow above her. The film is beautiful despite itself. And the doctor's house is a strangely twisted place for the home of a blind girl, a suggestion of paternal disinterest. What we have is a story that references Carmilla,  the Parker-Hume murder case (probably unintentionally), The Exorcist, and more. It is a wailing, hysterical film, a psychedelic horror-melodrama that has no truck with realism or subtlety. It is defiantly anti-authoritarian, irreligious, anti-science, anti-patriarchy, and anti-cruelty all at once. It shows its true colors in a sequence in the tomb, where Justina assaults one of the sisters and is held at bay as the sister prays not for herself, but for Justina to be protected. It is a moment of mercy, compassion, and selflessness, not of sanctimony, not of dominance, not of faith, but of love. And it works, until the doctor's somber masculinity and heartless vengeance end it. In all turns, the authority figures in this are the ones who drive the young girls to darkness and pain, and who create danger for the innocent. The doctor leaves Alucarda with his blind daughter; Alucarda is driven to Satan by the overbearing life of growing up in a convent.  The film has strong lesbian themes as well. The blunt metaphor for repression and the internal struggle and pain of it is fantastic, but it gets drowned out. Everything gets drowned out in blood and screams of anguish, which isn't a complaint. This film is as much about teenage angst as it is anti-authoritarianism. It's about rebellion--""I only repeated what you said"" the girls taunt, a reflection of teenage angst if I ever heard one--and the temptations of youth. It is a violent, sacrilegious, erotic nightmare, but mesmerizing. October count: 10/31.",5,116,3,792,"13,951",6-Oct-14,0

Mysterious 15-year-old friends Justine and Alucarda begin a very close and potentially sexual relationship as they live in a convent/orphanage with a bunch of nuns. In the 1860's this could cause a whole selection of problems but believe me this film is not about any of the above as it hits on the horror head right after the intro. Justine and Alucarda meet a band of mysterious gypsies and before long they unleash a demonic force from a burial site nearby.  Once this occurs, prepare for the most screaming you have ever heard in a movie.  As our girls begin to feel the effects of angry demons near lots of religion, destruction is inevitable and death will come to many. The film almost becomes one big set piece for annihilation and it is bloody good.  It has the feels of THE EXORCIST meets SUSPIRIA in the 1800's with its own take on turning everything up to 11. There is a constant sound of threat throughout that keeps on delivering, there is a lurking groan that soundtracks alongside an extremely disorientated score that may lack the impact of SUSPIRIA or THE EXORCIST scores has its own tranced like and cursed qualities.  The film contains some of the tensest scenes regarding religion versus demonic possession and most of these include the nuns that are caught in the crossfire and the star of the show Tina Romero who plays Alucarda. Romero puts on one hell of a performance and it feels criminal she did not portray a dozen or so other memorable characters.  I mentioned screaming earlier, the last quarter of the film contains a cacophony of screams as hell breaks loose.  Your eyes will be transfixed in the anarchy.

I thought instantly of this one, which I've wanted to revisit ever since I realized it had the same director as the surreal Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon. I blithely rented Alucarda as a teenager under the retitle Innocents from Hell, since it was one of the few tapes in Ken's World of Video's sprawling horror section with a naked lady right there on the cover. (Ken's also had the Comet big box of Alien Prey, but someone had torn the bloody boobs off, the implication of which always seemed more damaging than the original image.) Since I could remember very little about the movie except the premise of possession at a nunnery, I'm glad I can now echo the praise it's been gathering since Mondo Macabro's DVD came out. The story is fairy tale-simple, with orphans Alucarda (Tina Romero) and Justine (Susana Kamini) falling in love immediately upon meeting at the convent. Personally, I get weirded out if someone gets as instantly clingy as Alucarda is with Justine, but that's probably too boring a perspective for this phantasmagorical friendship. Especially when, on what seems to be their very first day of capering about the property, these young women meet some nefarious Romany, wander onto a foreboding burial site and come back spewing Satan-worship bile. The priests flagellate themselves while the nuns writhe in religious frenzy, with Sister Angelica (Tina French) praying so hard for these corrupted souls that she starts levitating. None of this actually helps, though, so the bossy head priest (David Silva) decides an exorcism is necessary. This turns out to be a Inquisition-level fiasco that leaves Justine dead and Alucarda under the protection of the local doctor (Claudio Brook), who cannot fathom how superstitious these Catholics are... that is, until the Devil's forces threaten Alucarda's new playmate, his guileless blind daughter (Lily Garza). Folks make a big deal out of how outrageous Alucarda is, so I kept anticipating something really gory or shocking that I didn't remember, which never came. Granted, the conclusion is an impressive spectacle of screaming and destruction that involves one of the possessed girls rising naked out of a coffin filled with blood before making a bunch of holy people burst into flame. Still, it's a relatively smooth path to this chaos, in that it features everything you'd expect from a tale like this, provided you're not looking for softcore nun fetish stuff. While not heavy on explicit blasphemy, the atmosphere remains so beautifully morbid that the sacred trappings become inseparable from the horror, including the bizarre, gauzy all-white nun habits, speckled with faded pinkish stains that make the sisters look like bandaged burn victims or bloody mummies who were run through a few wash cycles. There's even an apparent critique of religious fanaticism, although ultimately the extreme measures could be seen as justified if you consider the relentless evil that no doubt enslaves Alucarda and Justine, so take this as you will. I suppose it wouldn't be a classic exploitation flick without some degree of mixed messaging, and I cannot imagine this particularly well-crafted one will slip my mind a second time.",4,16,0,96,485,9-Oct-19,rated-7
Alucarda,1977,74,thriller,horror, , ,3280,40 fans,3.51,15,59,47,176,234,631,705,878,243,292," You call yourself blessed, and believed in the heavenly army, and worship death! I worship life, you worship death! I love Justine, you love to kill! Alucarda is about conflict. Aggressive editing and creative, intense cinematography and close-ups seize your attention and refuse to relinquish it for its entire breakneck runtime, force-feeding the audience panicked possessions and theological anguish and hellfire sermons hollered from altars beneath a mountain of mutilated Christs—plus just enough truly horrific sequences to remind you what kind of film you're watching. The nuns, wrapped in tight robes like mummies or brides of Frankenstein, demand you to look closely at their faces and the film will frequently fill the frame with those faces looking directly back at you. Each shot is a sucker punch, except for the ones that linger. They don't draw out, they aren't long...they're lingering, they're just too long and just too uncomfortable; there's a slow 360-degree camera pan in which the head priest plans an exorcism with a circle of nuns that's later followed by a somber, wordless zoom towards the victim of that exorcism on her deathbed, in which another nun faints next to it and is wordlessly carried off by her sisters. These are merely my favorite shots in a film that is never not interesting for a single minute of its brisk seventy-five. Alucarda is about conflict between Alucarda and her lover Justine, the devil that possesses them, and the Catholic convent in which they live. Alucarda was born in a barn that not-so-subtly mirrors the sepulcher from which they free a diabolical force, a force that taints their romance and acceptance within the convent. Alucarda and Justine seemed to be in love before they even arrived at that hellish tomb, but being possessed by devils made them resist the oppressive convent in which they lived. They stood up against their teachers, they proclaimed their love for each other, and Alucarda even beats up the head priest—maybe letting Satan in is a metaphor for coming out. When Justine is killed by the head priest in an exorcism (she's the aforementioned victim in my favorite shot), the way her hand shoots up from her still body—smash cut to Alucarda screaming, screaming, screaming—is like a triumphant fuck-you to the insitution that tried to kill them and keep them apart, but the Church succeeds the second time. Justine is melted by holy water after she kills the nun that tried to save her and Alucarda, realizing that her mere existence and unholy influence has done nothing but kill other women, self-immolates. She's a lesbian. She's a devil in a convent (but she'll take the whole damn convent down with her if she has to go). Alucardais about conflict but I mean this most significantly in that it creates a conflict that looms off the screen, out through your television, and basks you in its shadow, too. Sure, it's cool and fun to identify with the cool witchy lesbians who burn down the dogmatic and oppressive Catholic convent—but how much liberty are we and should we be allowed to take in the reclamation of monsters? From Milton to Jagger, we have always had a tendency to extend sympathy to the devil, but for as long as the devil represents all evil, that action cannot be done easily or totally without conflict. If Alucarda is supposed to be the hero of this movie, and if Justine is supposed to be her tragically slain lover, how do we reconcile this interpretation with the way the Puritan ideology they're rebelling against makes equal monsters out of the non-heterosexual and the non-consensual, how their Satanic ""love scene"" is just as guilty of blurring those lines? How do we reconcile the way Satan in this film is depicted as a horrific amalgam of Romani stereotypes, even if that's true to the real-life imagery of Satan from that time period? And how do we reconcile this film's revolutionary heroines when they are repeatedly abused, repeatedly naked (and diegetically underage), and are directed by men, shot by men, written by men, cast by men, and for men? How do we reconcile our personal feelings towards any film that exists not just in our hearts but in a vast and complicated kyriarchy? Is it enough to have a ""problematic favorite"" or is merely acknowledging these aspects a poor excuse for not completely resisting them? Alucarda is about conflict. Horror is about conflict. Without this conflict we cannot understand nuance, power, lived experience, and empathy with others. So I am wary of those who, when extending sympathy to the devil, do so too easily or totally. And I am wary of all those tumblr blogs run by horror dudes that seem to post nothing but gore-spattered and half-naked women.",5,6,3,90,338,3-Jan-19,rated-10

I'm 100% satisfied. Is it perfect? No. In particular, the emotional heft of the doomed-lesbian-lovers-in-a-convent story (which is really the heart of this thing behind all the Satan stuff) is hampered somewhat by a lack of characterization of either of our two heroines, and a sort of insta-love thing that happens within the first five minutes and undercuts any genuine sense of romance or even just sexual attraction. If you contrast it with something like Vampyros Lesbos in this department, it's nowhere near as believable or resonant (the two actresses here don't have nearly the same kind of chemistry either). There's also just a little too much of the film's runtime that's taken up by women just straight up screaming. Don't watch this with a migraine. All that said, when the Satan stuff does get going (and it gets going pretty quickly), you can kind of just put all that stuff out of your mind and enjoy the freakout. At one point I remarked to the friend I was (remotely) watching this with that it's the most 70s movie I've ever seen, and it's true: the weird synthesizer music; the camera work; the hair; the blood-splatter; the gleeful transgressing of taboos (even more so with a Mexican film, I'd imagine, than for an American movie like The Exorcist). If anyone ever asked me to show them the essence of 70s horror in one film, this might be it. Something interesting that came out of watching this with a friend is that part of how well it works, as with all Satanic horror movies, has to do with your own relationship to Christianity or at least to religion. I was raised Catholic enough that the convent setting and all the religious dressing vibed hard for me, but I wasn't raised so Catholic that depictions of Devil possession generate much existential dread for me today. Unlike a lot of atheists, I phased out of Christianity gently, without ill will or bad memories, and maintain a decent interest in Christian philosophy and theology. Conversely, I've also inherited a perverse love of Satan and all his accoutrement, so while this movie didn't hit me as hard as it might have if I'd ever really strongly believed in any of that stuff, on-screen blasphemy still turns me on in a way that only really happens, I guess, if you've been around the Church at least a bit and at least nominally believed at some point in your life. Contrast that with my friend who, in his own words, is ""a black void of religion"" and (don't worry; he gave me permission to share this) once asked me whether it was Christianity or Catholicism that was the umbrella religion (even now he still has to remind himself by thinking back to my response that ""it's the one with his name in it, you idiot""). He enjoyed the really bananas parts of Alucarda, and appreciated the message of ""this is what happens when you don't let people love who they want"", but the Christian setting did nothing for him, and he was bored during any part that dwelt too much on the religious stuff. So YMMV, as the kids say, but personally this hit all kinds of buttons for me, and I'd recommend it to anyone with similar buttons. You know who you are.",7,8,0,99,59,23-Sep-20,rated-9

Juan Moctezuma was a collaborator with Alejandro Jodoworsky, he made films on the edges of cinema, he maintained his strong artistic pride and made films how he wanted. Alucarda is a goddamn masterpiece. Surreal, emotionally charged, political and vindictive, curious and violent, honest and shrouded in mystery. What a fucking trip. At 78 minutes the film wastes no time. We are almost immediately sent into a dizzying world of Satanic cults and demonic possession. All the characters are performed as heightened versions of themselves giving us naked, raw emotion in every scene. It escalates and then tries to find another path forward for its characters and then explodes into one of the best finales. It spares no quarter, has no reserves of it content, it just goes for it and is one of my favorite things now. Holy shit!

I like some of the '70s Mexican art-house aesthetic like the bloody bandaged nuns and one particular scene involving scalding holy water.  But overall, Alucarda feels like a kernel of a possession / girls gone wyld / Catholic guilt horror concept stretched waaaay too thin over 75 minutes.

Once I saw the previews trailers they would include with each disc hooo boy I knew I'd be spending a lot of money with Mondo. That's where I discovered several of my favorite movies, including Alucarda. This movie definitely isn’t for everyone, besides being a slow burn with a big payoff there's a lot going on here... and director (and a producer on Jodorowsky’s El Topo) Juan López Moctezuma isn't afraid to exploit a variety of topics taboo for the mainstream of 1978: Demonic possession, Satan worship, vampirism, sacrilege, murder, orgies, clerics shown as tyrants, exorcisms, and perversely defiled religious imagery all show up in the 85 minute runtime. I definitely see the Exorcist meets The Devils comparison, and with Alucarda hysteria reigns supreme—whether it be the visual bludgeoning of the Church, insane amounts of screaming, or the heavy metal ending that comes roaring at you like a grand piano being dropped from the Empire State Building. It’s become one of my favorites that I seem to love more and more with each revisit, if this sounds like your satanic erotic nightmare jam, try to catch it on the big screen for maximum effect. Not for everyone, but certainly for me. *If you liked this, and haven't seen them, chrvk out Satánico Pandemonium, Don't Deliver Us From Evil, and of course Ken Russell's The Devils (a bit harder to find again now that it's no longer on Shudder).",5,78,3,588,"7,081",27-Jun-18,rated-9

If you get offended, disturbed and/or annoyed easily, the film is not for you. Directed by Juan López Moctezuma, who was a friend and frequent collaborator of Alejandro Jodorowsky, the film follows two orphan girls living in a nun convent who become close friends and unleash a satanic force that takes possession of them. ""Alucarda"" uses visuals and sound to push things forward. There's not much of a story here, but it doesn't matter, because the film's main concern lies elsewhere. It's almost like it seeks to play with one's emotions and sanity. There is a great amount of screaming and panicking. This is done on purpose. It's a technique borrowed from Jodorowsky and according to him it is used to keep the audience on edge and to bring tension to its boiling point. It really works. Visually, everything seems very theatrical. Most of the locations look like sets, but they're very beautiful and organic. For instance, there is a cave-like room full of crucifixes that looks as if the crucifixes were carved off the rock and are one and the same with the room. It looks gorgeous. There are plenty of good looking set pieces and scenes that showcase the skill and knowledge of the director. He was clearly influenced by what the French and Italians were doing at the time. And like many of the films from the day, there is no shortage of violence, blood, nudity, orgies and themes such as sacrilege, satanism, lesbianism, demonic possession and exorcism abound. Only one thing bothered me a bit. The acting is curious to say the least. It is delivered in various degrees of quality. Sometimes it's really good, and another times quite laughable. There is also an abundance of overacting, but I suppose it goes hand in hand with the overabundance of screaming. Either way, it's a bit distracting. Alucarda's performance though, was quite the treat. The actress who portrayed her had the perfect look, voice, and delivery needed for the role. It's almost hypnotic.

Two young women, both made to live in a convent by family circumstances beyond their control, quickly bond and grow close. Quick is the operative word here, as this film's pacing is always teetering on the verge of spiraling out of control. In one scene the two meet, then they frolic and giggle together in a field, then they are pledging their undying love for one another. This barely takes more than ten minutes. Somehow, it works. The relationship is immediately earnest and sweet, and it allow us to fall straight into Satan worship and possession without wasting a moment, and really without having enough grounding to find our footing. The convent never feels entirely ok, which heightens the mood immensely. Of course, the beautifully haunting set design (large cavernous rooms with gigantic religious setpieces) and nuns in bloody robes help with that, too. Once Satan shows up, well, all Hell breaks loose. Shout out to the orgy scene that features a big goat man, either Satan himself or one of his lesser demons, seemingly walking around to give people little pats and encourage them in their blasphemous sex. It's that sort of movie, and I couldn't be happier. Everything becomes a whirlwind of blood, fire, and screaming. For a movie about falling in with the forces of evil, the piercing stare is a crucial element, and I'm so pleased to report that Tina Romero has one of the best. Sometimes the film dwells on particular scenes, but it always retains that ability to suddenly accelerate wildly like the opening, chaotically cutting back and forth, abandoning any sense of patience. Beyond the intense presentation, yes this is another story of repression boiling over, Satan representing an opportunity for women who will take absolutely anything they can get to live outside of the system they were born into. It's telling that our only glimpse at the religious teachings are pure fire and brimstone fearmongering. I've seen it before, though it's done well and appeals to me. Moreover, I appreciate how overtly lesbian this one is. Allegorically, feeling any love for each other that goes beyond detached, sterile nun relationships is their deadly sin. The exorcism within this film might as well be conversion therapy, so I appreciate how damaging the priest's ""help"" itself is shown to be. I had a fantastic time watching this, really my only complaint is that by the end it becomes a little much. This must have one of the highest ratios of screaming (completely ear piercing, vocal chord shredding screaming) to runtime of any movie I've ever seen. A point exists where it crosses the threshold into becoming an annoyance -- I'm willing to forgive because the movie is so damn good, but I did hesitate for a moment with the 4.5.

There are too few moments of consequence, despite what should've been some very serious developments as the bikers clash with each other and the townspeople (in a pared-down 50s sort of way).

Man, this movie really made me feel like I was given a glimpse into '50s culture.    There isn't much of a plot at all.  It's really just a series of events that takes place over a couple of days in a smal town, yet it draws you into a world where Freedom was the American Dream and fist fights were a norm in every day life. Despite a lack of plot, it engages you, thanks to some great performances by Brando and Lee Marvin, who plays the leader of a rival biker gang.  What I loved most about it is that it's a character study in which we don't know if the hero is really a hero or not.  Slowly we realize that Brando's character is the most flawed of them all.  He is the epitomy of the rebel who is a rebel for the sake of being a rebel.   The ending chase sequence is well-shot and memorable.  Great cinematography and lighting which goes well against the black and white picture.  It really takes you into the period in which it takes place.  I felt like I could relate to Brando's character the more it went on.  A victim of society who threw up the middle finger and never gave up, even if he never had a choice.

How puritanical were the British of this era? Obviously, the influence of censors neutered many films, but the fact that The Wild One shows nothing and has violence/action that is no more detailed or violent than many of its contemporaries makes this an odd one to censor. Perhaps they thought Johnny Strabler (Marlon Brando) was just too cool that kids would emulate him? No idea. All the same, The Wild One burst onto the scene in most places in 1953 with Brando’s big-sideburn, hat-wearing, jacket-covered, and motorcycle-riding bad boy coming onto the scene at the same time, leaving an indelible mark on American culture. The film itself definitely does not live up to that legacy, largely existing as a means of showing just how cool Johnny - and, by extension, Brando - is but the film is not particularly successful on that front either. Perhaps this one is tough to watch without being a rebellious teen as you start to identify with the at-his-wits-end Sheriff who just wants Johnny to get the hell out of town and express legitimate worry over what Johnny will be like if he cannot even express basic human emotion. Johnny Strabler is a lost young man. He leads the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, states he will rebel against anything, hates cops to the point he will not go with a cop’s daughter, and he has no idea how to communicate basic emotion. All of this, unfortunately, makes him quite dull to watch at times as he just kind of stands there with Brando acting the hell out of the role but not saying much. Nonetheless, when given a chance to be cool and brash, Brando exudes that charisma and style that Johnny should have, while also proving to be quite the intimidating figure. His tragic past - claims that his “father hit harder” certainly hint at some kind of physical abuse - and the refusal of anyone around him to show him any decency, always assuming the worst instead makes it hard to not see why this young man has become so incredibly jaded over the years. The world has rejected him, turned its back on him, and told him to get the hell out. He maybe earned it to some degree, sure, but there is life and regret in those eyes which Brando wrings out in spades from beginning to end. The film hints at an interesting direction when Chino (Lee Marvin) rolls into town, fights with Johnny, and reveals that their respective clubs were once one large club that split up about a year ago. Had the film indulged in this warring motorcycle gang angle, it could have really been quite the thriller. Instead, Marvin is largely relegated to a background role - that he nails all the same - with Chino even seemingly respectful and loving towards Johnny even when Johnny does not say much. As foils, they work quite well together with the loud, expressive Chino tapping into a great manic energy that a rebel biker could have as opposed to the downtrodden introspection expressed by Johnny. Together, they work quite well as rival motorcycle gang leaders and The Wild One is at its best when playing up the ominous arrival of Chino and the eventual fight between the pair. While it is a bit funny to see the big, bad motorcycle gang throw the town into chaos via walking across a racetrack or by dancing, The Wild One does at least examine 1950s conventions and fears quite well. From the buttoned up prior eras, the 1950s burst onto the scene with a rebel and angry energy that would eventually lead into even greater rebellion in the 1960s. For the elder generations, they fear the decay of social mores with old man exclaiming that, with the advent of “pictures”, nobody even talks to one another anymore (where have you heard that before?). The townsfolk desperately try to keep order and instill respect into the bikers, but wind up displaying their own form of barbarism and impatience, instead opting to view the bikers as some subhuman group of delinquents undeserving of human decency. As the motorcyclists fight back and cause chaos to just been seen, demanding respect in the process, it is hard to not see this as a great encapsulation of the struggle between the older generation to keep everything the “same” and the demonized younger generation trying to bring about change. Yes, the motorcyclists are criminals, but even young Kathie (Mary Murphy) wants change, desperately trying to get out her small town in favor of excitement and adventure. All the while, the white old men who run the town try to hit the pause button and keep everything the same forever, for fear of losing the control they have over the town. Visually, The Wild One never falters with some seriously impressive nighttime shots of Johnny riding around on his bike or a greatly intimidating moment where the gang surround a home with only their headlights visible in the dark. Shots of Kathie running through alleyways to escape a group of bikers feels cut from the pages of noir films, delivering a great beauty but also a great menace. These bikers are acting out more-and-more as it gets later in the day with the shadows and dark creating a cloak of darkness that they clearly intend to use to their advantage in committing crimes. The end result is a rather menacing film at times with the lighting helping to create that atmosphere. The use of shadows, whether in those scenes or otherwise, are also quite strong with DP Hal Mohr actually having quite a neat shot in the police station. As Sheriff Stew Singer (Jay C. Flippen) talks to Kathie, only his shadow is seen on the wall behind her as he seems to loom over her as an intimidating presence. This is a continuation of a shot, to some degree, of the Sheriff looming in the mid-ground and sitting on his desk as Johnny is slumped in a chair in front of him in the foreground. The staging/framing of these scenes really captures that emotion and then rather powerful presence possessed by the cops in this town. As a whole, The Wild One is a bit of a mixed bag. It is pretty good, but far too tame to be taken completely seriously nowadays. Its characters are all pretty one-dimensional, giving this great cast very little to chew on in practice, which is definitely a bit of a disappointment considering this is really peak Brando in the lead role. Nonetheless, the gorgeous visuals and smart themes definitely help out, while Benedek is able to create quite an interesting and thrilling atmosphere for the action. Unfortunately, the film follows some crime/police angle as opposed to indulging its more interesting side, ignoring the potential excitement and intrigue of a battle between these two motorcycle gangs.

Certainly, it dabbles in the corruption with the law and the destructive nature of delinquents, but otherwise it centres mostly about a bad person who has the chance of redeeming himself.

With a great performance by young Marlon Brando who had just emerged from a string of highly acclaimed roles in Streetcar Named Desire and Viva Zapata! and who was just about to star in the magnificent On The Waterfront, this little film about a gang of rebel bikers definitely influenced an entire generation of youngsters and produced a crack in the facade of moral correctness that had defined Hollywood for decades.  However, in contrast to the works that stemmed from the hippie rebellion against The Man in the sixties and seventies, The Wild One didn't necessarily intend on doing so, as it assumed a tone of a Hitchcockian thriller and by admitting in the opening frame that something shocking was about to happen, it committed to building a thick atmosphere of suspense, in which it succeeded for the most part. Thanks to this narrative operation, The Wild One is still an entertaining picture about rebellion and the societal defensive response to it that forms a horrific snapshot of America of its time, which extends far beyond the subject matter and can be used as a vehicle in a conversation about civil rights, institutional prejudice and simple human dignity.  And, quite accidentally perhaps, the fact the antiheroic character of Johnny Strabler became a sort of an icon is enough to make the case that change was needed; a change that came much later, more violent and corrected the course of the Western civilisational progress for many generations. And cinema formed part of that monumental force.",3,2,0,153,720,12-Apr-17,rated-8

Starring Marlon Brando, Robert Murphy, Lee Marvin and Mary Murphy. The Wild One was controversial at the time of its release due to the film’s subject and did not get shown in cinemas for 14 years, but the result is a very decent if difficult watch, even though the film is rated Parental Guidance here in the UK.  Johnny (Marlon Brando) and his bike gang arrive in Carbonville for a motorcyclist rivalry and increase enough agony to get thrown out of the area. They overhaul to nearby Wrightsville and carry on their supremacy of trouble.  The local sheriff (Robert Keith) is destitute to stop them, but when a competing gang enters, he manages to capture their leader, Chino (Lee Marvin). Meanwhile, Johnny finds himself really liking the sheriff's daughter, Kathie (Mary Murphy), and chooses to spend some time with her.  Marlon Brando gives a very good performance in his role as Johnny, the leader of one of the gangs involved. He suits his role well, but Brando might be more remembered for his part in the adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play Julius Caesar, which got him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and won him a BAFTA in the process.  Elsewhere, Lee Marvin is decent as Chino, the person in charge of the other bike group who gets in big trouble, while Robert Keith is fine as the sheriff who is unable to stop one gang, and Mary Murphy offers respectable support as the sheriff’s daughter who Johnny falls in love with.  The direction from Benedick is very good because he allows the facial expressions to be seen to a strong effect throughout, while also keeping a very tense atmosphere happening as well (it does feel like you are watching a horror film) and the script is written to a decent standard by John Paxton and Ben Maddow as they make the movie good to follow.  The technical aspect that stands out best is the camera, because this makes very good use of the locations and also captures the tense and dramatic moments well, which get the edge-of-the-seat status.  This movie may run for only 79 minutes, but there is lots happening from beginning to end.

Benedek's dull film sounds great on paper - a social drama about a group of bikies who terrorise a small town due to a clash in values. Sadly though, the film is a hollow experience - a film in desperate need of a charismatic lead, it ultimately fails due to Brando's inability to do much more than pout and look miserable. This may work in films like Streetcar and Waterfront, but when the film revolves around the leader of a motorcycle gang, a leader of many men, you need an actor that can show leadership whilst also showing the conflict in their heart. It makes the entire film unbelievable, and the only time the film and Brando show any spirit is when the utterly charming Lee Marvin arrives to challenge everything.

Both stories deal with rebel justice and rogue vigilantism, while the latter’s subject matter is obviously more serious than the former. ",2,2,0,69,125,1-Jul-19,rated-8

Johnny's voice over at the start suggests he doesn't quite understand how any of it happened, or at least how it turned out, which is a little disingenuous. I mean, they do play on the idea of an escalation of ill feeling, but right from the start the BRMC are tearing the place up, and Murphy's character genuinely seems to be moments away from being raped before she's whisked away on Johnny's bike. Regardless, the movie doesn't seem to want to make any judgements (even if it does err on the side of sympathy for Johnny), and it's really no more than a standard teen exploitation flick.",2,3,0,35,108,17-Jun-18,rated-6

Yes it was the first ""outlaw motorcycle gang"" film, but in a very tame 1950s way, and so the only thing that's shocking today was the hysterical overreaction that greeted The Wild One upon its release. Brando plays Johnny, the bikie leader whose group and their old rivals, led by a young and almost unrecognisable Lee Marvin, cause some minor havoc in a remote backwater they happen to meet in. Johnny and a girl who works at the local diner fall rapidly and unconvincingly in love, while at the same time a pitchfork wielding mob is mustered to drive the motorised hoodlums out of town. There's no attempt at character and motivation, so most of the runtime is focused on the low-level antics of these rebels without a cause (apparently James Dean was inspired by Brando here and incorporated much of Johnny's persona into his own mildly anti-establishment pose), making this more of an exploitation picture than serious drama. Brando was far better in the following year's On The Waterfront (1954) meaning that The Wild One is more a historical curio than worthwhile film you should seek out.",1,2,0,84,169,25-Feb-19,rated-5

It's fair to say it's not exactly swung my opinion either as it's just not very interesting at all. I don't think its problem is that it's aged, although watching bikers dancing to swing music doesn't do it any favours on that front. For me, its problem was more in the age it was made. It feels so restricted in what it can do and say that Marlon Brando's rebel without a cause (hey, that would be a cool name for a film!) ends up looking a bit, well, shit. This kind of thing was really impossible to do effectively under the Hays Code and things never really get that heated at all. Brando's fine here but his character is shit. I can see why he might be regarded as the face of rebellion back in 1953 but even then he must have looked to many like nothing more than a sullen crybaby arsehole who gets a 'ride off into the sunset' send-off that he doesn't deserve at all. He doesn't even fucking say sorry at the end, why am I supposed to get behind this guy. He only gives Mary Murphy his dumb trophy because he would have ended up in the clink for manslaughter if it wasn't for her. Twat. To be honest, this film really only livens up when Lee Marvin comes into it and as I didn't know Lee Marvin was in it, it has saved The Wild One from the trouncing of a review it deserves. He's not just great because he's Lee Marvin here but because his character seems to be an actual wild one rather than a navel-gazing depressive who probably spends his spare time making emo mixtapes. He would have made for a far more interesting lead for this film, drunkenly terrorising a small town and being a general loud and loutish bastard. Otherwise it's a tame and pointless film that does earn one extra half a star for the hilarious death of that old bloke.",6,24,17,469,"10,150",19-Apr-17,rated-5

When you start the film you right away think of how cool Brando was back in the day.  I mean I felt that as you first get a glimpse of him on his motorcycle.  Granted, the opening is him and two others riding in front of a running film of people riding on dirt roads. Ahh the old studio tricks of the 50s. The biggest surprise for me as the film went on was that Lee Marvin stole the film for me.  I enjoyed his character, Chino, more than I did Brando's Johnny.  Marvin is energetic, riotous, and wild.  While Brando is obviously being cool.  They play off each other well and are very entertaining.  I'd have loved to have a film of just Chino as well.  No way that guy didn't get into some shenanigans. The film itself doesn't have much of a plot other than a bunch of bikers ride into a town that doesn't really want them there.  The story revolved around Brando and the sheriff's daughter more than anything until it turns to the town's people forming a posse to take care of Brando.  I think the idea for the film was to be about rebels or outsiders. What it certainly did was make Brando look cool and make him a cultural icon of the time. It's a short film, so I will certainly recommend a watch.  It's pretty iconic.  And maybe if made in the 60s it would be more wild and be able to do more, but in the 50s it was hard to pull that off.  You have to push past the censorship and realize that they had to pull back on these films.

Intense and brooding he was the anti-hero archetype and seemed more real than anyone on film.I have never seen this film until now and had kind of dismissed it as one of the many juvenile delinquent films that populated the fifties and sixties. As such, it held little interest to me. It is the risk that when you are one of the first that you get copies to death by more inferior cash ins to the point that the qualities the original possesses gets lost in time.THE WILD ONE is about a biker gang that stops in a small California town and the mayhem that comes from the clash between the citizens and the rowdy gang. The leader, Johnny finds himself intrigued by a local girl and it tests his attitude of indifference. Mischief ensues and violence erupts and Johnny grows a bit as an adult.Watching it from a remove this many years later it seems tame and silly, but it easy how to imagine how this would frighten people of the times. With their slang talk it seems as if they are speaking a different language and their unruliness which while playful to them is looting. The fact that there are so many of them, many scenes show them swarming cars or leering at people, increases their threat. Their playfulness and snubbing of authority also makes it obvious that teens would want to emulate them.Brando is central here and is completely riveting. His iconic look with the black leather jacket and hat cocked to the side is still seen today. He exudes danger in every moment, a live wire about to go, but also shows the young man inside. It is a perfect performance.Mary Murphy holds her own as the love interest to get under his skin. She looks lovely and demure, but she really shows the longing and all of the scenes with her and Brando really crackle with tension.Everything outside of them seems overacted and melodramatic, but it doesn't hurt the film.

Now, of course, it's laughably old-fashioned, almost a parody of what it was originally intended to be.  At its centre is a somewhat pudgy Marlon Brando, the wild one of the title, the antics of whose motorcycle gangs causes all sorts of consternation in a small American town.  Brando, himself, is meant to be some sort of existential anti-hero, (""What are you rebelling against?"" ""Whattaya got""), but despite the Stanley Kowlaski pose, he's miscast; he seems so much smarter, so much more distant from the rest of his gang.The director was Laslo Benedek, who at least tries to give the film some kind of raw edge, (one scene, where heroine Mary Murphy is being chased by the gang down some very mean streets, he handles superbly), but the producer was Stanley Kramer who imposes that straight-laced morality of his into every scene.  We are meant to condemn these hooligans just as we are meant to empathize with Brando's tenderness; after all, he's just a crazy, mixed-up kid with a good heart.

This is why the film is remembered today. Yet as much as I find the outlaw outfits quite, for lack of a better word, cool, I still fail to find more out of The Wild One than a messy episode of irrelevant drama.  The film seems to be easily summed up by a motorcycle gang crashing at diner/bar, a useless cop, his curious square daughter whom Johnny has an eye on and a stolen trophy. Also, the characters can be too conveniently categorized into either a hooligan or a square and the actual event that is so heavily mentioned in the credits doesn't really live up to the hype.

What I loved most about it is that it's a character study in which we don't know if the hero is really a hero or not.  Slowly we realize that Brando's character is the most flawed of them all.  He is the epitomy of the rebel who is a rebel for the sake of being a rebel.   The ending chase sequence is well-shot and memorable.  Great cinematography and lighting which goes well against the black and white picture.  It really takes you into the period in which it takes place.

Of course the films appeal was all about Brando who already had his landmark ""Streetcar"" performance under his belt and was just about to do another Kazan masterwork ""On the Waterfront"". Here hes far from peak form, easily getting out shined by Lee Marvin in their big scene together. Mostly he just seems uncomfortable with the contrived cheesy biker dialogue, which to be fair is the main reason for this films problems.  There is good in this film however, starting off with the great shot of the bikers driving right towards the camera some barely missing it. The direction from Laslo Benedek is solid, bringing some chaos and tension to the bikers various misbehavior's (namely driving around in circles, using mops for wigs and drinking incessantly).

The Black Rebels Motorcycle Club are a bunch of assholes who ride into town, harass women and old people, cause accidents, and commit general mayhem, all while delivering slick, defiant lines in early 1950’s slang that the “squares” don’t get.  The town’s sheriff is feckless and weak, and his shrugging and “what can I do?” responses quickly get annoying.  A waitress (his daughter, of course) is assaulted but somehow still falls for Brando (argh), and then the townsfolk decide they’ve had enough and form a vigilante mob.  Maybe in all of this there is an ink blot whereby who you sympathize with says something about you or maybe your current station in life, but for me, it was close to being none of the above, and it was tough to see the film tilt its sympathies to the motorcycle gang.  The latter is of course helped in no small part by Brando’s considerable screen presence. The performances are generally good, and aside from Brando, Lee Marvin is great as the leader of a rival gang.  What a fine actor he was, and with The Big Heat coming out the same year, 1953 was certainly a good one for him.  I liked the direction from László Benedek, especially when he put Brando and the young woman (Mary Murphy) in close up, or gets interesting shots of the swarm of motorcycles, which descend on the town like a plague of locusts.   The oft-quoted response of Brando’s to the question “Johnny, what are you rebelling against?” (answer: “What have you got?”) seems to capture a nihilistic attitude so perfectly that although memorable, was somewhat off-putting to me.  However, a much smaller line delivered later, when he’s getting beaten up by the people of the town who have had enough of his gang running roughshod over everything, contains the glimmer of something kind of hidden, and probably the best part of the film for me.  He says “My old man used to hit harder than that,” and in that little moment, it hit me that he was the product of abuse and a difficult childhood.  Reflecting on it, the feeling grows.  Why is this guy so attached to a silly trophy that one of his gang member’s swiped from a racing competition?  Why does he allude to having made a deal with a cop once (and was presumably betrayed)?  Why can he not simply express gratitude in the scene at the police station, why is it that “he doesn’t know how”?  He has not seen enough kindness in life, and in acting out sees even less of it, in the spiral to becoming a misunderstood outsider. I don’t know if there is quiiite enough of this aspect to balance out Brando’s character, much less how all of the others behave in the film.  Maybe the film is the truest test of empathy, or maybe this guy’s just a punk who should behave better (albeit an iconically cool punk mind you), or maybe it was ahead of its time in showing the inevitable rebellion to the norms of post-war America.  Maybe all of the above.",4,6,0,91,146,3/8/19,rated-7

While many of its characteristics chiefly spoof reality television, in particular PBS’s 1973’s An American Family, incorporate an inherent bleakness, he prepares his arguments humorously and entirely successfully.   In many ways, it functions as a mockumentary as a film crew sets out to record a year in the life of a regular American family, and the prevalence of the topics are brimming with a forward-looking commentary on socialisation as his quarry encompasses not just reality television but also documentary filmmaking. The movie tackles aspects which were ahead of their time and the sufficient comedic tone is established beautifully by the typically and deliberately impassive performance of Charles Grodin as Warren Yeager, the dysfunctional family's patriarch.  It's an innovational debut from Brooks and incorporates the comprehensive edgy irony which he evolved from the short films he did for the first season of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and the restrained and subtle self-deprecating parodies elatedly don't attract undue attention to themselves; displaying the ingenuity and uninhibited psyche of Brooks to be firing on all cylinders.",3,60,3,"6,764","12,333",16-Aug-20,rated-8

I mean, this was basically some Nostradamus shit in predicting the birth of reality television shows. Albert Brooks deserves all of the credit in trying to warn us of this incoming apocalypse, but sadly no one listened, and luckily it seems as though the fad has died out. As far as the film is concerned, I really don't have any complaints, other than the fact that it just simply didn't impress me on the same level as it seems to have done for most people. That is, of course, a purely subjective issue. Real Life is a genuinely original comedic work that didn't really seem to play off of anyone else's tropes. Now, whether or not that comedy will work for you, is again another subjective dilemma. I appreciated the ingenuity of the film, and honestly there were even several moments that were pretty damn funny, (including that twisted ending). However, it wasn't a hysterical gut buster. Aside from a television film, this appears to be Albert Brooks first directorial film and he actually does a wonderful job. Think about trying to tackle a meta film that you also star in as the lead role for your first directing effort?

From the ages of about 8 to 14, I would watch any reality tv show I could get my hands on. This meant if it was airing on TLC, I was gobbling it up. Toddlers and Tiaras, Say Yes to the Dress (I was partial to the Bridesmaid edition), 19 Kids and Counting, Breaking Amish, Long Island Medium, and of course Jon and Kate Plus 8. I don't watch reality television (or much television at all unless it's one or two seasons long) anymore but for some reason when I was a child I could not get enough of it, and it hardly mattered what the subject material was as long as it was dramatic. I think my formative years being so inundated with reality television is the main reason Real Life filled me with such a sense of dread. Albert Brooks was seeing right into the future of television with Real Life and his movie was so prophetic it's terrifying. I was especially reminded of Jon and Kate Plus 8, a show that clearly led to the destruction of the marriage of the couple at the core of the show, with the ego and pressures of newfound fame splitting up a big but seemingly average family. The Yeagers are ultimately not coaxed by the promise of fame, but Brooks' maniacal rendition of himself is coated in the narcissism of the moviemaking business to the point where his project to depict reality in its most pure and uninterrupted form becomes (nearly from the beginning) a quest for so-called ""action"", which mostly translates to tension within the family unit. Brooks, at his most desperate for exciting material for the movie, tries to instigate an affair between him and Mrs. Yeager. Brooks' original quest to depict life in a scientifically productive way is similar to how TLC branded itself originally as The Learning Channel, and like Brooks by Real Life's end, TLC understood quickly that the easiest and most financially successful way to gain the public's attention was through ""action"" and maybe a house fire or two and most certainly not through scientific breakthrough and education.  The mortifying thing about Real Life is that TLC is not where media's mission to portray every second of an average family's reality has stopped. With the Internet and YouTube came 'vloggers' who filmed every single day in their lives, again often destroying their romantic relationships in the process. Currently YouTube is a hotbed of ""couple channels"" and ""family channels"" filled with exploitation of children for views (often this content is viewed by other children, eerily mirroring my own childhood experience of watching Toddlers and Tiaras or Dance Moms) and fake ""pranks"" and break ups for the impressionable but invested audience. In the most direct parallel to Real Life and the film's finale, a family channel pretended they had to flee imminent danger during the California wildfires a few years ago so they could get a clickable title out of it. So I guess Real Life is literally real life. The amazing thing is that Real Life still, to this day, works as a satire. Compared to another 70s satire The Candidate which has become totally obsolete 40 plus years later, Real Life is still sharp when it comes to satire on television's presentation of 'reality' and also its satire is focused on more than just the movie within the movie being filmed, with the cult of celebrity being the other major satirical interest. Basically, Real Life's satire has only become more relevant due to social media instead of becoming obsolete as pop culture heightens into even higher level of cynical ridiculousness.",3,25,2,330,675,24-Oct-20,rated-9

Brooks showed us personal privacy as a fungible commodity. He understood that the audience craves fake, reality sucks. He knew that cups without balls doesn’t mean jack shit.

The parodical template is the domestic ethnography of PBS’s An American Family series, Albert Brooks comes to it equipped with Martian helmet-cameras and loads and loads of self-absorbed abrasion. Playing a comic-cum-documentarian named ""Albert Brooks,"" he serenades the Phoenix locals with an updated version of ""Something’s Gotta Give"" before inaugurating his experiment, a year-long recording of a nuclear family headed by Charles Grodin and Frances Lee McCain. ""Be yourselves"" is his only direction; the first day of filming is barely over and the irritable wife has already taken off, only to return and take the crew with her to the gynecologist’s office. As the months pass, the filmmaker frets about his ""leading man"" coming off as unsympathetic, old-Hollywood studio bosses push for celebrity replacements, and the clan’s submerged despair rises to the surface. The first of Brooks’ analytical comedies is his funniest and most rigorous, built with subtle whiffs of Kubrick and anchored by the awareness of every moment being recorded and watched. A work of vacant spaces, of the distance between psychiatric meetings and show-biz focus groups, reportage and involvement, subject and camera. The matter of ""altering the reality you’re filming"" is what one contemplates with Flaherty and Warhol, here the director is not averse to hitting on the wife if it means advancing the narrative. ""You think you have it bad? I have to deal with people like John Simon and Rex Reed!"" Brooks notes the family’s depressed complicity in its own manipulation, yet saves the sharpest knives for his own character—the schmuck-artist chasing the ghost of vérité until the literally incendiary inspiration of taking control of the mise en scène.

Brooks playing himself is a strange move for someone’s directoral debut but it totally works. His charisma and charm really adds to the already staged production. This film foreshadows reality tv as we see it today, big time. Not at all real but fully staged and peppered with content from the producers.

Brooks’s status as comedy maven is not jeopardized, but his debut shows the signs of someone too eager to make a name for himself, not yet confident in his subtler and more refined abilities. That introductory Q-and-A conference is atrocious and had me seriously worried; it is precisely the sort of sketchy textbook drollery that Brooks, to my mind, had successfully circumvented (and to some extent, downright obliterated) in later films like MODERN ROMANCE and LOST IN AMERICA. It’s obviously a lampoon, but it’s too strident for its own good, and frankly not that funny no matter how you parse it. The whole downward spiral conclusion is ridiculous, too—again, yes I know it’s intentionally overboard, but satire isn’t nearly as effective when it smothers you like a smoke grenade. Having Brooks descend into psychosis and plagiarize a famous film ending unto his own is a great setup; having him proceed to burn down the family’s house is a lukewarm excuse for exaggerated pseudo-drama. Tripping out of the starting block and crawling through the finish line tape are not ideal ways to win a race.  But everything in between is marvelous and, as with Brooks’s best comedies, the marvelousness lies in the less emphatic details e.g. whenever one of the crew members with the obnoxiously massive camera helmets appears randomly off in the background or scurries into the frame to reposition themselves. (Not only is this a superb example of physical comedy, it directly combats Brooks’s direction to the family to “live their lives as you normally would” and to pretend that him and his crew “aren’t even there.” How the hell could anybody ignore those?) Had a great time watching the father repeatedly try and fail to plaster a smile on his face as he watches his family crumble apart in front of his eyes, constantly breaking the fourth wall to explain to the theoretical viewers that these rifts are uncommon. Brooks himself is loaded with an arsenal of gold, as you’d expect—my favorites: ”I’m locked into a PG” to the wife, who invites him to film her gynecologist appointment, and ”The operation was over at 11:45, well ahead of schedule,” narrating the father’s botched horse surgery. The self-centered narcissism that has defined several of his characters henceforth is present and wonderful, too—after he gets done spending minutes talking about how great and luxurious his new house is, he briefly tosses off: ”The rest of the crew stays at the TraveLodge. A nice place.” Stumbles into a compounding absurdity once the family slips into a deep depression from which it never totally recovers. But there’s enough incredible material packed densely into the middle of this that the opening and closing stanzas are worth enduring.",3,11,3,92,"2,227",14-Oct-20,rated-7

I was sure this movie pretty much invented ""Reality Shows,"" when in fact its pretty much an adaptation of the first example of a ""reality show."" Part fiction, part reality, part social experiment - Albert Brooks debuts as a director on this film within a film about a ""real family"" whose being followed throughout his life in and outside his home as a group of cameras shot (or rather say, staged) their lives... but nothing goes as plan.  The acting here is so great, especially by Brooks. This is probably his best role EVER, a role that pretty much encapsulates what he was, were and will be doing after the release of the feature. He's so brilliant at playing this neurotic, narcissistic man. The rest of the cast is in for the game. The script is filled with so many brilliant lines and dialogues (""...I will show those French people how you do a montage"") that are just hysterical. Some of the vibe and style in the film reminded me a lot about the work of Woody Allen, not sure if he was influenced by him or what, but you do get the feel of some of his works like ""Manhattan"" and ""Annie Hall.""

While many of its characteristics chiefly spoof reality television, in particular PBS’s 1973’s An American Family, incorporate an inherent bleakness, he prepares his arguments humorously and entirely successfully.   In many ways, it functions as a mockumentary as a film crew sets out to record a year in the life of a regular American family, and the prevalence of the topics are brimming with a forward-looking commentary on socialisation as his quarry encompasses not just reality television but also documentary filmmaking. The movie tackles aspects which were ahead of their time and the sufficient comedic tone is established beautifully by the typically and deliberately impassive performance of Charles Grodin as Warren Yeager, the dysfunctional family's patriarch.  It's an innovational debut from Brooks and incorporates the comprehensive edgy irony which he evolved from the short films he did for the first season of NBC's Saturday Night Live, and the restrained and subtle self-deprecating parodies elatedly don't attract undue attention to themselves; displaying the ingenuity and uninhibited psyche of Brooks to be firing on all cylinders.",3,60,3,"6,764","12,333",16-Aug-20,rated-8

For one thing, it's a very meta film, a film about comedian Albert Brooks and a group of psychologists making a film about an average American family made by Albert Brooks. For another, without doing any research, this has to be one of the first mockumentary films, and it was co-written by Harry Shearer who would go on to act in and write ""This is Spinal Tap"" and have a hand in virtually every other Christopher Guest mockumentary film (whose body of work probably comprises the bulk of the entire mockumentary genre). And for yet another ahead of its time touch, the entire movie satirizes Hollywood business practices, cultural anthropology, the whole Reality entertainment boom and how studying a subject can interfere with the life of the subject itself.  This is a downright brilliant movie, quite ingenious in its touches and little details (I particularly love the sci-fi looking cameras that the cameramen documenting the family wear). Brooks and Shearer clearly have put an incredible amount of thought into this scenario and mine the potential problems inherent within it for hilarious effect. Brooks gives a wonderful, self-skewering performance that completely obliterates any sense of pretension that might be a danger of this whole enterprise. Charles Grodin is fantastic, as usual, as the put-upon head of this family. And Frances Lee McCain is also great as the wife of the family.  Everything unfolds in unexpected, consistently hilarious fashion and the intelligence level is high throughout. You might think this cerebral approach would undermine the number of sheer belly laughs that this movie can generate but, fortunately, you'd be wrong. It's as laugh out loud funny as it is smart and biting. It loses a bit of momentum in the last half, but aside from that this is magnificent, deeply funny stuff. And though the momentum does flag a bit, Brooks manages to pull off a nearly perfect ending that more than makes up for it. I feel like Brooks has a reputation as the West Coast equivalent of Woody Allen, but that seems unfair. He's got his own quirky persona, his own flavor and flair, despite the fact that both men get a lot of mileage out of neuroses. Brooks seems more in tune with the moment (not hard compared to a man who scores most of his films with 1930s jazz music) and, at least in these early films, is a lot more interested in society at large and the culture that shapes us and sometimes damages us. I'd doubt any film shows that as remarkably as this one.",3,10,0,"1,411","1,140",24-Aug-16,rated-9

Real Life isn't outrageously funny, at least that wasn't the case for me, though I haven't found any of his work to be that way despite still enjoying it, but it is consistently amusing, very clever, brutally incisive and pretty much sets the bar for the mockumentary subgenre which wasn't even really a thing yet back then. As usual, Brooks blurs the line between his character and his real life persona, weaving in the narcissism, insecurity and jittery energy to increasingly maddening effect. It's scary to think how far we've come since homes were first invaded with TV cameras—here hilariously mounted on the heads of the film crew in what for me was its best running gag, now we're the ones generously sharing the banalities of our lives on social media 24/7 without batting an eyelid, a madness that in a way far exceeds even Brooks' prescience.

Albert Brooks (née Einstein) applied the Observer Effect to show business and real life and discovered the formula: Reality + Observation = Fake  Real Life didn’t just predict the future, but manipulated time and created our present. Brooks showed us personal privacy as a fungible commodity. He understood that the audience craves fake, reality sucks. He knew that cups without balls doesn’t mean jack shit.

Yes, there's the Japanese-made wall-mounted heat-sensitive cameras, but to catch what those can't, you have, from Holland, the Ettenauer 226-XL.

The story of Ice Age: The Meltdown continues the journey of Manny, Sid & Diego who embark on a new adventure after finding out that the ice age is nearing its end & with all the melting ice, a great flood is approaching. But on their way to a higher ground, they discover that Manny isn't really the only woolly mammoth left alive. Directed by Carlos Saldanha, The Meltdown carries itself on the momentum provided by previous chapter and packs in enough moments of laughter to keep its audience amused for the most part. The arcs of recurring characters don't really evolve by a notable margin, the story itself follows a generic route & humour is a bit juvenile at times. Scrat is still the best character in the movie and his endless pursuit of the prized acorn is a never-tiring concept that effortlessly provides the comic relief whenever needed. The voice cast of Ray Romano, John Leguizamo & Denis Leary is joined by Queen Latifah & Seann William Scott and all do a fine job at it & play their characters accordingly. On an overall scale, Ice Age: The Meltdown applies the same formula that made its predecessor a refreshing delight yet ends up inferior in content and one reason for that is its inability to improve upon the shortcomings of the first film. However, despite not being as emotionally fulfilling as the original, it delivers on its promise of offering a fun-filled extravaganza.",5,33,0,662,"8,792",18-Apr-16,rated-6

The returning characters are still good, but these new characters are kind of just okay. Certain things feel ever so slightly rushed, too.   And that’s how I feel about this film.

The first of the many Ice Age sequels but Ice Age: The Meltdown does a solid job of expanding the franchise.  It manages to keep the heart and fun of the original film. I think the story progresses in a natural way with Manny fearing he may be the last mammoth before meeting Ellie, who's a pretty fun character. Diego's subplot of confronting his fear of water was well handled although Sid's subplot of wanting more respect really doesn't amount to much. The global warming plot is pretty good though. Unsurprisingly the best scenes come from Scrat the Squirrel in his never ending pursuit of the acorn which leads to him battling piranhas and vultures. This poor squirrel just can't get a break can he. The animation is really good looking. The jokes are pretty funny although some of the adult humor in this one feels out of place. And there are some really great scenes like Ellie's flashback. Ice Age: The Meltdown isn't as good as it's predecessor but I think it's a decent enough sequel.

Is just more Ice Age, one thing to praise about it however is that it still follows a story that mades more sense at least, I say this because we all know this is something the two last entries lack of. The film is still enjoyable as the first one with a plot interesting enough to keep me watching the film, the OST is still pretty solid and the original trio still has it’s pretty fun moments. So yeah is just more Ice Age, more fun Ice Age, however what made me put it bellow the original Ice Age is that unlike on the previous film it’s comedy felt flat most of the time, it wasn’t nearly as funny. Also, I felt the new characters pretty lame & uninteresting, this is where the franchise starts giving us an unnecessary expansion of characters that made it feel more dull. Crash & Eddie are kinda annoying too. I mentioned on the review of the first film that its emotional moments didn’t worked at all, however I found here they worked even worse, maybe is because of what I mentioned regarding the characters, but I didn’t cared at all about Ellie realizing who se is because I didn’t liked her, her romance with Manny felt pretty forced and most importantly, that conflict was a bit stupid for my taste. For the animation, while it looks better I find many effects regarding the water pretty poor, then again compare it to Finding Nemo from 2003 an even older film but that has definitely aged better regarding this aspect. Besides all the cons, as I mentioned the movie is still enjoyable and has its pretty fun moments like that Sid the Sith subplot that while was such an unnecessary addition was hilarious & actually more interesting than the romance and Ellie’s conflict the film has. This is once again harmless entertainment that doesn’t does nothing outstanding or that I could highlight. Is more family animation focused primarily for kids where adults can be still entertained.",4,7,2,120,156,12-Jul-20,rated-6

Ice Age: The Meltdown,2006,91,animation,comedy,family,adventure,65281,9 fans,2.86,563,2133,2590,10350,10646,20835,8745,6423,848,2148," When the first ""Ice Age"" came out back in 2002, it became a big surprise hit. The film became the highest-grossing animated movie of that year, received many award nominations including one for Best Animated Feature at the Oscars, and put Blue Sky Studios on the map to become a big mainstream animation studio. Naturally, with all that success, a sequel was inevitable. Pretty soon afterward, a second ""Ice Age"" was eventually announced which later went on to be known as ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"". While the film was once again a massive box office success, it wasn't as warmly received as the first film. Having watched it again after so many years, I can understand why. The film isn't terrible by any means and overall it's a pretty average sequel, but the film is pretty flawed and just doesn't hold the same weight as that first film did. Then again, the first film was pretty hard to top. A few years have passed since the events of ""Ice Age"" and our trio of heroes, Manny (Ray Romano), Sid (John Leguizamo), and Diego (Dennis Leary) have been living in the warmer valley away from the ice age, with the only ice being a giant wall surrounding the valley. However, they soon learn that the ice behind the wall has melted and that the wall has now become a giant dam waiting to burst and flood the valley. After learning of a boat that's at the end of the valley, the trio then set off on their quest to find the boat and survive the incoming flood. Meanwhile, along the way, Manny begins to wonder if he is an endling as none of the other animals have seen in a mammoth for a long time only to run into another one named Ellie (Queen Latifah). She seems kind and sweet, though she doesn't exactly know she's a mammoth as she believes herself to be a possum along with two twin brother possums named Crash and Eddie (Seann William Scott and Josh Peck). From there, the herd sets off to get to the boat on time while Manny tries to connect with Ellie and hopefully convince her of her true species. Like the first film, the story seems simple enough. It's once again easy to follow and isn't overly complicated like the later sequels would get. However, it doesn't continue all the strengths that worked in the first film. There are some emotional moments that work well like the moment where Ellie finally realizes she is a mammoth and we learn of her origins. Like the cave scene in the first film, it's told all through the visuals and I think it was superbly done. That was probably the only moment I actually thought was well handled as the other emotional moments didn't see that grand or huge to me. The comedy in this film was also very hit and miss. Sometimes they got a big laugh from me or a mild chuckle, but other times they made me groan very loudly. The first film had some dud jokes as well, but at least it had more good ones to make up for it. In this film though, the bad jokes sort of linger which was not a good sign. As far as the animation goes, it's definitely an improvement from the first. The animals and their fur are really well defined here and I think it still looks pretty good. There are times though where some of the water animation looks pretty bad. One of the big instances happens near the end of the film and it looked simply dreadful.  I still think the characters work well though. When it comes to the old ones, Manny, Sid, and Diego are all still charming and likable and even Scrat is still hilarious with his subplot trying to get his precious acorn. When it comes to the trio, they really began to expand Manny and Diego with Manny being worried about starting a new family after his old one was killed and Diego trying to conquer his fear of water. Now, let's get to the new ones. Ellie is not bad. I do think she's likable and goofy and even sweet at times and she works well off of Manny. Crash and Eddie on the other hand, I could do without. These characters did annoy me and honestly felt kind of pointless. I guess Blue Sky wanted to add some comic relief into the mix even though they kind of forgot Sid was already one. Honestly, Crash and Eddie should've been cut since they didn't add much to the film and mostly annoyed me, even though they did have one good joke. I'm also conflicted by the film not really having a major villain. There are these two sea reptiles that do chase our heroes, but they only come into contact with them twice and didn't really pose a huge threat. You could also make the argument that a group of hungry vultures were the villains, but they really didn't do much except intimidate our heroes and at one point broke out into a very awkward rendition of ""Food Glorious Food"" from ""Oliver"" which only just added more filler to the film. Speaking of filler, there's also more of it in this film and it really didn't do much for me. Personally, ""Ice Age: The Meltdown"" isn't a bad sequel, but it's not a great one either. The story is nice and simple again but has some hit and miss moments, the animation is pretty good but has some bad water effects at times, and the older characters are charming once again but some of the newer characters don't work for me. This certainly isn't a bad sequel, but compared to the first ""Ice Age"" it simply isn't as strong. I still think it's average though and I do slightly recommend it for those curious enough to watch it, but it's definitely not a sequel I plan to watch again anytime soon.",4,4,0,1,264,9-Jul-19,rated-6

I knew it was hailed as one of Korea's best horror movies, and one of the best films from director Jee-Woon Kim. As a fan of both Korean cinema and Kim, deciding to watch this was a no brainer.  After finishing this movie I have 3 things to say: 1: Why can't American horror movies scare me like foreign horror movies can 2: Kim sure does have a weird collection of movies under his belt(I Saw the Devil, Tale of Two Sisters, The Last Stand.) That last one is a big WTF... 3: With all of this talk of North Korea threatening nuclear destruction, I hope South Korea doesn't become their first target. I WANT MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS. Kim does a good job of offering up some great scares here that I have personally found to be nonexistent in America recently. Some movies like Sinister make some good attempts but fall short to genre inches that American horror can't seem to get away from. Now I'm not saying Tale of Two Sisters is perfect, because its not. It's gets off to a dreadfully slow start and some vague plot points and head scratching plot points dampened my spirits a little bit. Where I Saw the Devil was a fast paced brutal game of cat and mouse, this one takes its time and plans its scares perfectly. And that's the big thing here. It's scary. And when someone like me who is pretty much desensitized to the genre says that, Im convinced I have a really special film in front of me. I'm sure the film will get better with each viewing but as it stands now it gets 3 and a half from me.  This movie has been hailed as an Asian horror masterpiece and I can see why. While its not quite a masterpiece in my book, it still goes down as one of the most frightening films I've seen.",8,14,1,"7,594","4,661",8-Mar-13,rated-7

It seems filled with secrets and untruths, as if it's the story of a family with warring factions. It's about being out of place amongst your family, although quite who this applies to is fluid within the film. Yet it isn't even that, it's a twisty tale about a world of quiet craziness. The final act is not foreseeable from the first, and yet it is satisfying in its refusal to explain itself. It's a film of awkward moments surrounded by other moments of sheer terror. Domestic life as internal pain. There's a stillness to the house, as if the air and all who breathe it are stale. A stopped clock, deserted swings, a body in a sack, nobody is ever there. Hands grasped together, the sisters may be unified, even if reality is not. Through controlled style, we get aesthetically pleasing terror. The scariest moments utilising bright, contrasting colours, and the creepiest utilising flashes of light surrounded by darkness. A Tale of Two Sisters is scary and strange, an ambiguous tale with ambiguous characters living in an ambiguous world. Rooted in Korean traditionalism, A Tale of Two Sisters pushes itself to be cerebral in its homemade horror of changing family dynamics, and it hangs together as a capable little arthouse horror.",1,28,4,748,"7,956",27-Jul-18,rated-8

The opening scene with the psychiatrist seems out of place and needless at the front end. It should have been saved until after certain surprises come to light. Would have made for a better story. Also, it introduces the possibility of hallucination and that is just unneeded and ultimately REDUCES the horror that could have been much more without the possibility that some of this MIGHT be happening in the girl's mind.  So... a really bad editing choice there.  On the POSITIVE side, there is a LOT of REALLY CREEPY stuff happening throughout the film. The ghost stuff is very ominous and scary. Some good scares as well. Nice.  It's also beautifully shot. Some gorgeous images that frame the beauty around all of the horrific and mysterious stuff that is going on in this house.  When the explanations come at the very end, they are pretty interesting, and change how you view things... however, I do wonder if the movie could have been edited a bit more cleverly to engage the viewer more and to ultimately make the reveal a bit easier to grasp.

The plot requires the attention of its viewers from start to finish and presents many hints & visual motifs throughout its runtime that can easily go unnoticed. The film opens by introducing us to Su-Mi; a teenage girl at a mental hospital. That scene is followed by Su-Mi coming back home with her father & sister where her overbearing stepmother is waiting. Soon we find out that something isn't right in the house and from then on, the film throws one twist after another until the third act where it finally reveals the dark secrets but in a manner that will require another viewing or two for some to fully decipher it. Director Kim Jee-woon (A Bittersweet Life, The Good, the Bad, the Weird & I Saw the Devil) has tackled a wide range of genres in his directorial career and has proved himself to be a versatile filmmaker who has the calibre to add his unique flair to any story. And that's what he does here by adding an emotional understudy to this horror fable. Cinematography encapsulates the whole film with an eerie atmosphere with its methodical camerawork & accurate lighting while editing uncovers the film's layers in a composed manner. On an overall scale, A Tale of Two Sisters is a tense & mind-twisting chiller that has many moments of nightmarish terror embedded in it and is at its most shocking when you eventually figure out the whole story.

I suppose I may have had more patience if there’d been more to the story (which is told so clumsily, it seems to have baffled half its audience), but that final payoff (played deadly serious) was just so absurdly hokey to me it undermined the whole film, and in an extremely rare instance, made me feel like I’d just wasted two hours of my life.

You can find my list here if you'd like to follow along! Long before director Jee-woon Kim would marvel me with the powerhouse I Saw the Devil he had already directed the acclaimed A Tale of Two Sisters; a film I'm ashamed to say has spent nearly a decade idling on my watchlist for no better reason than that my watchlist is mighty cumbersome. Having heard nothing but praise for such a long time, I couldn't help but go into the film with elevated expectations, along with a simmering fear that they would not be met. Thankfully, they were; or perhaps they were even exceeded.  At the time that this film originally came out, I was very into Asian horror films, and thinking back to the possibility of seeing this then gives me a funny sort of nostalgia. Even having not seen the film, I couldn't help but feel as though I had been transported back in time while watching it; to somewhere hauntingly familiar, when the sensation of a film getting under my skin wasn't so uncommon. I got chills more times than I can count during this film, and every time I thought it could end or it had done enough, it would persist and press the envelope a little bit further.  I could break the film down piece by piece, paragraph by paragraph like I usually might, but I hardly think it would do it justice. The are simply no weak links that I can identify. The score is hauntingly beautiful, melancholic and subdued until it bursts to life at the conclusion. The set is gorgeous and eerie, somber and shadowy with lush splashes of blue and red on the walls and furniture. The camera glides around with clear intent, like a roller coaster of fear and emotion (my goodness, the scene where it revolves over the shoulders of two characters, revealing everything to the viewer). This is how you make a film. There are, of course, various twists in the film that I will not divulge (nor reference similar films, in case of spoilers by proxy). I felt very comfortable that I had solved one of them within about 2 minutes of the movie starting, which perhaps may not have been the case had I seen the film much earlier, but it never detracted from the film for me. In fact, if anything it lulled me into a false sense of security concerning other twists and turns that the plot would take that are truly eye opening when used as a lens to look back on earlier events in the film. If you're like me and you just haven't made the time for A Tale of Two Sisters yet, I urge you to do so. Prioritize it; bump it up to the top of your list. It deserves it.

Thankfully those lucky enough to be aware of the original can still discover the horrifying delights of this film, in one of the best to come from the genre in the past decade or so. The film isn't without its problems however but the skilfully crafted atmosphere more than compensates for those issues. There is no hurry to get to the heart of the story which is what makes this so effective. The idea is to play between the lines of the real and imaginary, while still managing to scare the pants off you. Monsters are shown early enough although they may not prove to be the real villains of the piece, or rather the type that haunt this young girls memory or designed to truly unnerve us as those later in the story will. It's as much a horror as it is a drama about guilt and loss, the overbearing sense of grief continuing to harbour in those asked to move on with their lives. Memories and emotions transform themselves into ghosts that work as the haunting metaphor for the girl. Layers are peeled away slowly by Kim Ji-woon before the final act reveals where the truth really exists sweeping everything that came before it aside as a distortion of reality. Clues are dropped along the way and Ji-woon does his best to explain the final reveal but it can't escape being a bit of a muddle. Was everything she remembers a complete warped fabrication or if not, how much of the truth impacts onto the outcome? Is the final flashback what really happened or more distortion? We have to presume it is the former as the start of the film clearly tells is this us being told through her eyes. A little nod toward where life may lead her next would have been helpful but the director keeps that last mystery to himself. An 'otherworldliness' exists in the house where nearly all of the film take place, everything in it looking a little too delicately positioned. Ji-woon doesn't untangle the story completely but he sets the foundation of the film in a very firm position so it can deliver the right kind of face-covering scares at the right moments.

A tale of grief, love, loss, anger, denial mixed in with a handful of creaking creeps in dark places. A well presented story, wrapped in a strange, yet nicely decorated house, supported by the occasional musical score. These brightly dressed characters are at odds, but their reasoning may not be as clear as it seems. Nothing is actually, when even the characters themselves can't be sure of what they're seeing.  It's a little too quiet in the first act, but gradually picks up in the second and continues its smooth and spooky pace from there. As sparse as the score is, it's memorable for me, as I've had the soundtrack for probably 15 years and have listened to it plenty. The iterations of Crying Moon are my favourites.  It will always be a pretty film to look at, but not as engaging as I would like. A tale I continue to revisit on occasion, as there's often some small detail to discover, that I may have overlooked the last time.

A Tale of Two Sisters is a clear inspiration for many popular Hollywood horrors that are still going strong (in terms of profit) now. Take The Conjuring (and its many sequels and spinoffs) or Insidious (and its many sequels) - these two franchises feel a lot like A Tale of Two Sisters, so much so that the similarities get freaky. This one is more frightening though, for sure.  Jumpscares, easily the most frequently panned technique in horror today and I get that, it has become a cheap getaway for directors to call their films scary without making anything of intelligence, but it's also a technique that works. Some people out there need to understand that in order for a jumpscare to work, the scene needs to be well crafted enough for you to be watching the screen closely, then BANG - all hell breaks loose in your body, bones shake, your heart skips a beat and you are impacted by the screen in front of you. The jumpscares in this movie (along with The Conjuring 1 & 2) are effective because the craft beforehand is atmospheric enough for you to be startled in the first place, and also the actual scare almost acts as a trigger for things to be scared of in terms of the plot, it's like it's a sudden slap in the face to remind you of the evil that's already happened. I don't know, I'm probably talking nonsense. I am unable to really put it into words but anyways, I really liked this film and its scares - they definitely done something to me.",2,15,0,244,862,14-Oct-19,0

His hands do not appear dirty. He has not, so far as we can tell, just used the toilet, nor is he preparing to eat or to engage in some practice necessitating sterility. He is merely awaiting a conversation. Nonetheless, he is fastidious about his washing. It is a curious image with which to begin Kim Jee-Woon’s A Tale of Two Sisters, but one that, eventually, makes a great deal of sense. For hand-washing, in the grand tradition of Pontius Pilate, is commonly associated with the cleansing of guilt, and guilt hangs over Kim’s picture like a deathly shroud. Of course, hand-washing is not always ablutionary—just ask Lady Macbeth. Sometimes the stain remains. Sometimes, as Eun-Ju (Yeom Jeong-Ah) says, things you would rather forget cannot be wiped away; instead, they follow you around like a ghost. There are ghosts that immediately announce themselves as such in Kim’s gothic tale of familial dysfunction and haunting, and there are ghosts that seem permanently embedded in the fabric of the country home at which most of the action takes place. And there are other ghosts that take time to come into focus. They haunt young Su-Mi (Im Soo-Jung) and Su-Yeon (Moon Guen-Young), sisters returning home after a stay of indeterminate length at a hospital, apparently recuperating from some unspecified mental distress. And they haunt the girls’ father, Mu-Hyeon (Kim Kap-Soo), and his new wife, Eun-Ju. What upsets them all will take time to crystalize, but this much is clear: The past has been unkind to this family, and it seems not to be done with them just yet. It is difficult to talk about A Tale of Two Sisters without talking about its back half, where the story is repeatedly upended in fragmented ways and where questions about what is real and what is imagined and who can be trusted pile on top of one another to the point that multiple viewings are needed to sort through all the puzzle pieces that Kim hands his audience. But those viewings are well worth it, not only to get a clearer picture of the film’s events and themes, but to soak in the lush, gorgeous world that Kim has created. Like all great horror movie houses, the family’s rural Korean home becomes that hoariest of clichés—a character unto itself—a grand, menacing place of dark beauty, worthy of endless exploration of its meticulously designed nooks and crannies. The house is dark, of course, with much rich wood and never an unnecessary light turned on, but most striking is Kim’s enchanting use of color. The dining room and kitchen, where many important scenes take place, are awash in green and red: red flooring, greenish cabinetry, green wallpaper with red and white flowers. The sense is of a place visited by spectral beings and violence, a place that is striking in its beauty but unsettled—a beating, sanguinary heart hoping for peace but roiled by the rot of the past. The colors continue to pop up throughout the costuming and the home, most notably in Su-Yeon’s bedroom and in the flowered wallpaper that lines the house, its frozen blooms suggesting an unhealthy stasis out of which its residents struggle to break. The most notable breaks from this color pattern occur in the parents’ bedroom, overwhelmed with violet—the color of artificiality and ambiguity—and in Su-Mi’s royal blue bedding—the color of melancholy. As Kim and cinematographer Lee Mo-Gae’s camera glides elegantly through the home, the exquisite art direction seeps in, leaving subliminal sensations that deepen the creeping dread of the surface action. And dreadful that action is, most of all for the titular girls. Su-Mi, the older of the sisters, is petulant and headstrong and defiant. Unwilling to accept her stepmother’s intrusion into their family unit, she is cold toward her father—himself seemingly emotionally numb—and angry toward Eun-Ju. Though Su-Mi’s actions at times seem immature, it is hard to blame her. Eun-Ju’s behavior is erratic, swinging between shrill, unconvincing, nearly hysterical forced cheer and grotesque evil-stepmother cruelty—other than her beauty, it is hard to see what Mu-Hyeon might see in her. And as family photographs insinuate, she did not come into her role honestly. Instead, she wormed her way from nurse colleague to Mu-Hyeon’s physician, then to live-in nurse for the girls’ ailing mother (Park Mi-Hyun), and finally to mother’s replacement. She could hardly have made for herself a steeper climb into her stepdaughters’ good graces had she tried. Su-Yeon, the younger sister, is meek and timid and retiring, lacking the obstinate bluster of her older sibling, making her the perfect object of Eun-Ju’s most aggressive disdain. Where Su-Mi is inclined to fight back against her stepmother’s brittleness and harsh words, there are increasing intimations that the woman may have done more than just verbally abuse poor Su-Yeon. After Su-Mi discovers marks on her sister’s arms, she vows to take decisive action in protection of the young girl. While this is the general outline of Kim’s dark fairy tale, it says little about the feeling of watching his film. Moments of intense creepiness are dropped in, with sound design and image combining to produce palpable unease. Noises are heard upstairs. A door opens and a hand wraps around it. A lurching ghost crawls beside and onto a bed. A dinner guest suffers a most violent episode. Upon first glance, these moments seem to have little to do with what is happening around them, but their pull remains hypnotic, Kim’s careful framing and deliberate pace assuring the viewer that there is a method to his madness. When the flashbacks and revelations begin to cascade, they are truly heartbreaking—a reminder of how regret can linger, eating away from the inside like a virulent parasite. Decisions made in haste, guided by pettiness and animosity, almost always end in grief—a self-inflicted wound whose reach is far too long to outrun. The performances, particularly by Im Soo-Jung and Yeom Jeong-Ah, are remarkably nuanced, particularly in hindsight, walking a tightrope of emotions and perspectives that only coalesce and fall into relief late in the film. Su-Mi’s desire to protect her sister is instantly relatable, as is her teenage disposition toward short-tempered tantrums, while Eun-Ju is often a heartless demon of a stepmother but with glimmers of a woman trying to make the best of a difficult situation, with late-breaking notes of compassion and cruelty complicating her image immensely. Equally compelling is Lee Byung-Woo’s lovely, rich score, with its haunting notes of melancholy and fading happiness and longing and its exceedingly clever use of 3/4 time. The main theme will undoubtedly play in the viewer’s mind for days afterward, giving the world a sheen of impending autumn, as though the leaves might fall any moment. The final third of the movie, in which the film’s many secrets are spilled, is a dizzying high-wire act in which Kim manages to convey all he needs while leaving the viewer rather confounded. Repeat viewings make further sense of the fragmented information, but one does not walk away feeling more settled—if anything, the tide of tragedy and sorrow and guilt comes on even stronger as the full import of everyone’s sins (both of omission and commission) is exposed. It leads the mind to wander, back to things said that weren’t meant, back to actions taken out of childish spite, back to times when we couldn’t avoid being our worst selves. Whomever the person, whatever the moment, those blemishes never seem to go away. The best one can hope is to learn from them, since they can never be forgotten. They’ll always be with you—no amount of ritualistic hand-washing can remove the damned spot.",12,214,27,"1,139","4,959",30/10/14,rated-9

The plot requires the attention of its viewers from start to finish and presents many hints & visual motifs throughout its runtime that can easily go unnoticed. The film opens by introducing us to Su-Mi; a teenage girl at a mental hospital. That scene is followed by Su-Mi coming back home with her father & sister where her overbearing stepmother is waiting. Soon we find out that something isn't right in the house and from then on, the film throws one twist after another until the third act where it finally reveals the dark secrets but in a manner that will require another viewing or two for some to fully decipher it. Director Kim Jee-woon (A Bittersweet Life, The Good, the Bad, the Weird & I Saw the Devil) has tackled a wide range of genres in his directorial career and has proved himself to be a versatile filmmaker who has the calibre to add his unique flair to any story. And that's what he does here by adding an emotional understudy to this horror fable. Cinematography encapsulates the whole film with an eerie atmosphere with its methodical camerawork & accurate lighting while editing uncovers the film's layers in a composed manner. On an overall scale, A Tale of Two Sisters is a tense & mind-twisting chiller that has many moments of nightmarish terror embedded in it and is at its most shocking when you eventually figure out the whole story. Although it isn't a film that every cinema lover is going to enjoy, not even a film that every horror fan will enjoy, it still would be most rewarding for those who like stepping up to the challenge a cinema poses by presenting itself like a puzzle.

I love Kim Jee-Woon's directing style, it's refreshing, he mixes perfectly camera movements and still shots, and he works really well with the editor, the dream/flashback sequences were amazing!

You'd be hard-pressed to find a horror film with a better combination of cinematography, editing and performances... but even calling this a horror film feels wrong. The ever-mobile camera juxtaposed with the gorgeous set design makes for a fantastic visual experience, and the sound design is just as well put together. There were at least a half dozen points during the film where a certain sound effect or scream or something sent a shiver down my spine and made my body tense up.  A Tale of Two Sisters has an impressive atmosphere through which it disallows the viewer from being able to tell apart reality from fantasy. As a result, psychological and emotional instability become the main concentration of the film, rather than coherence or ease of understanding the narrative. This certainly does not lessen the beauty or mastery of the film, though it does call for repeat viewings; it's the kind of film that with each time one watches it, they gain a better understanding of the events that transpire.

Edit: now that I have read this thread on IMDd, (no longer exists, unfortunately), I am raising my rating to a possibly too low 4.5/5, as I now consider A Tale of Two Sisters to be one of the most symbolically rich and abundantly detailed films of the 21st century, and I highly recommend visiting this thread as soon as you finish watching the film.

The story revolves around a sister who just got released from a mental institution, after being released she goes back to living with her family, consisting of her younger sister, her father and the father's new wife. Neither of the sisters like their new stepmother for reasons that are not very clear, all we now is that there is a massive amount of disrespect between the sisters and the stepmom and they are always fighting about something. Now when I think about it, how often has a stepmother been presented as a likeable character in any form of media? they are almost always portrayed as this coldhearted bitch who treats people like shit. I guess it is just a very easy character to use as a protagonist in a film where the main characters are children, the mother that they used to love disappears and is replaced by a person that they barely know, whether the stepparent is a bad person or not, the child will undoubtedly feel some animosity towards them. A lot of the horror in  ATale of Two Sisters comes from the cold nature of the family and their residence. The house feels empty and there is immediately a feeling that something terrible has happened in there and whatever that occurrence was it has left the family as a hollow shell of it's former self. The bits and pieces about what happened in this house are slowly given to the viewer throughout the film, but not always in chronological order or in ways that are instantly noticeable. It goes without saying that this is a film that has to be rewatched if you wish to fully understand it. This tragic story about a family is nicely kept together thanks to a cast of well-acted and intriguing characters, with my favorite being the eldest of the twin sisters. Without spoiling anything, I will just say that her character arc is a tremendous showcase in how to write a character with deep mental issues. A Tale of Two Sisters was a film that i knew nothing about before I watched it and I am glad that I didn't. To experience A Tale of Two Sisters for the first time without knowing anything about the plot is a very rewarding experience. I know for sure that I will rewatch it several times in the future because I know that I will enjoy it even more as I keep rewatching it and noticing new things about the tragic story that it tells.",6,19,0,555,808,30-Oct-15,rated-9
A Tale of Two Sisters,2003,115,horror,drama,mystery, ,22868,205 fans,3.65,43,147,181,828,1249,3910,5198,7238,2180,1894," A Tale of Two Sisters is another Asian horror that was unable to avoid the inevitable catastrophe; the American re-make. Thankfully those lucky enough to be aware of the original can still discover the horrifying delights of this film, in one of the best to come from the genre in the past decade or so. The film isn't without its problems however but the skilfully crafted atmosphere more than compensates for those issues. There is no hurry to get to the heart of the story which is what makes this so effective. The idea is to play between the lines of the real and imaginary, while still managing to scare the pants off you. Monsters are shown early enough although they may not prove to be the real villains of the piece, or rather the type that haunt this young girls memory or designed to truly unnerve us as those later in the story will. It's as much a horror as it is a drama about guilt and loss, the overbearing sense of grief continuing to harbour in those asked to move on with their lives. Memories and emotions transform themselves into ghosts that work as the haunting metaphor for the girl. Layers are peeled away slowly by Kim Ji-woon before the final act reveals where the truth really exists sweeping everything that came before it aside as a distortion of reality. Clues are dropped along the way and Ji-woon does his best to explain the final reveal but it can't escape being a bit of a muddle. Was everything she remembers a complete warped fabrication or if not, how much of the truth impacts onto the outcome? Is the final flashback what really happened or more distortion? We have to presume it is the former as the start of the film clearly tells is this us being told through her eyes. A little nod toward where life may lead her next would have been helpful but the director keeps that last mystery to himself. An 'otherworldliness' exists in the house where nearly all of the film take place, everything in it looking a little too delicately positioned. Ji-woon doesn't untangle the story completely but he sets the foundation of the film in a very firm position so it can deliver the right kind of face-covering scares at the right moments.

I thought I would adore this film because it is one of the most hyped films of the Korean New Wave and Kim Jee-woon is great but I think I messed up and saw this film 15 years too late. The style is definitely of its time. I can see the influence this film had on the last decade and a half of this genre -- especially the Blumhouse films like Insidious, Sinister, Conjuring, etc.  So I wasn't swept away because I'm so used to the style now.

It all makes sense in the end. Apart from the brilliant script, the film´s other strengths are the creepy and unsettling atmosphere, great set design (the movie mostly takes place in one location), stunning visuals, and strong acting performances. It is not as terrifying as I hoped, though, and has some minor pacing issues. All in all, “A Tale of Two Sisters” is an intriguing mix of psychological horror and family drama (a combination I love very much) that probably requires more than one viewing to fully appreciate it.

A Tale of Two Sisters,2003,115,horror,drama,mystery, ,22868,205 fans,3.65,43,147,181,828,1249,3910,5198,7238,2180,1894," Part of Hoop-Tober “I’ll always be with you.” In close-up, a man washes his hands carefully and repeatedly. His hands do not appear dirty. He has not, so far as we can tell, just used the toilet, nor is he preparing to eat or to engage in some practice necessitating sterility. He is merely awaiting a conversation. Nonetheless, he is fastidious about his washing. It is a curious image with which to begin Kim Jee-Woon’s A Tale of Two Sisters, but one that, eventually, makes a great deal of sense. For hand-washing, in the grand tradition of Pontius Pilate, is commonly associated with the cleansing of guilt, and guilt hangs over Kim’s picture like a deathly shroud. Of course, hand-washing is not always ablutionary—just ask Lady Macbeth. Sometimes the stain remains. Sometimes, as Eun-Ju (Yeom Jeong-Ah) says, things you would rather forget cannot be wiped away; instead, they follow you around like a ghost. There are ghosts that immediately announce themselves as such in Kim’s gothic tale of familial dysfunction and haunting, and there are ghosts that seem permanently embedded in the fabric of the country home at which most of the action takes place. And there are other ghosts that take time to come into focus. They haunt young Su-Mi (Im Soo-Jung) and Su-Yeon (Moon Guen-Young), sisters returning home after a stay of indeterminate length at a hospital, apparently recuperating from some unspecified mental distress. And they haunt the girls’ father, Mu-Hyeon (Kim Kap-Soo), and his new wife, Eun-Ju. What upsets them all will take time to crystalize, but this much is clear: The past has been unkind to this family, and it seems not to be done with them just yet. It is difficult to talk about A Tale of Two Sisters without talking about its back half, where the story is repeatedly upended in fragmented ways and where questions about what is real and what is imagined and who can be trusted pile on top of one another to the point that multiple viewings are needed to sort through all the puzzle pieces that Kim hands his audience. But those viewings are well worth it, not only to get a clearer picture of the film’s events and themes, but to soak in the lush, gorgeous world that Kim has created. Like all great horror movie houses, the family’s rural Korean home becomes that hoariest of clichés—a character unto itself—a grand, menacing place of dark beauty, worthy of endless exploration of its meticulously designed nooks and crannies. The house is dark, of course, with much rich wood and never an unnecessary light turned on, but most striking is Kim’s enchanting use of color. The dining room and kitchen, where many important scenes take place, are awash in green and red: red flooring, greenish cabinetry, green wallpaper with red and white flowers. The sense is of a place visited by spectral beings and violence, a place that is striking in its beauty but unsettled—a beating, sanguinary heart hoping for peace but roiled by the rot of the past. The colors continue to pop up throughout the costuming and the home, most notably in Su-Yeon’s bedroom and in the flowered wallpaper that lines the house, its frozen blooms suggesting an unhealthy stasis out of which its residents struggle to break. The most notable breaks from this color pattern occur in the parents’ bedroom, overwhelmed with violet—the color of artificiality and ambiguity—and in Su-Mi’s royal blue bedding—the color of melancholy. As Kim and cinematographer Lee Mo-Gae’s camera glides elegantly through the home, the exquisite art direction seeps in, leaving subliminal sensations that deepen the creeping dread of the surface action. And dreadful that action is, most of all for the titular girls. Su-Mi, the older of the sisters, is petulant and headstrong and defiant. Unwilling to accept her stepmother’s intrusion into their family unit, she is cold toward her father—himself seemingly emotionally numb—and angry toward Eun-Ju. Though Su-Mi’s actions at times seem immature, it is hard to blame her. Eun-Ju’s behavior is erratic, swinging between shrill, unconvincing, nearly hysterical forced cheer and grotesque evil-stepmother cruelty—other than her beauty, it is hard to see what Mu-Hyeon might see in her. And as family photographs insinuate, she did not come into her role honestly. Instead, she wormed her way from nurse colleague to Mu-Hyeon’s physician, then to live-in nurse for the girls’ ailing mother (Park Mi-Hyun), and finally to mother’s replacement. She could hardly have made for herself a steeper climb into her stepdaughters’ good graces had she tried. Su-Yeon, the younger sister, is meek and timid and retiring, lacking the obstinate bluster of her older sibling, making her the perfect object of Eun-Ju’s most aggressive disdain. Where Su-Mi is inclined to fight back against her stepmother’s brittleness and harsh words, there are increasing intimations that the woman may have done more than just verbally abuse poor Su-Yeon. After Su-Mi discovers marks on her sister’s arms, she vows to take decisive action in protection of the young girl. While this is the general outline of Kim’s dark fairy tale, it says little about the feeling of watching his film. Moments of intense creepiness are dropped in, with sound design and image combining to produce palpable unease. Noises are heard upstairs. A door opens and a hand wraps around it. A lurching ghost crawls beside and onto a bed. A dinner guest suffers a most violent episode. Upon first glance, these moments seem to have little to do with what is happening around them, but their pull remains hypnotic, Kim’s careful framing and deliberate pace assuring the viewer that there is a method to his madness. When the flashbacks and revelations begin to cascade, they are truly heartbreaking—a reminder of how regret can linger, eating away from the inside like a virulent parasite. Decisions made in haste, guided by pettiness and animosity, almost always end in grief—a self-inflicted wound whose reach is far too long to outrun. The performances, particularly by Im Soo-Jung and Yeom Jeong-Ah, are remarkably nuanced, particularly in hindsight, walking a tightrope of emotions and perspectives that only coalesce and fall into relief late in the film. Su-Mi’s desire to protect her sister is instantly relatable, as is her teenage disposition toward short-tempered tantrums, while Eun-Ju is often a heartless demon of a stepmother but with glimmers of a woman trying to make the best of a difficult situation, with late-breaking notes of compassion and cruelty complicating her image immensely. Equally compelling is Lee Byung-Woo’s lovely, rich score, with its haunting notes of melancholy and fading happiness and longing and its exceedingly clever use of 3/4 time. The main theme will undoubtedly play in the viewer’s mind for days afterward, giving the world a sheen of impending autumn, as though the leaves might fall any moment. The final third of the movie, in which the film’s many secrets are spilled, is a dizzying high-wire act in which Kim manages to convey all he needs while leaving the viewer rather confounded. Repeat viewings make further sense of the fragmented information, but one does not walk away feeling more settled—if anything, the tide of tragedy and sorrow and guilt comes on even stronger as the full import of everyone’s sins (both of omission and commission) is exposed. It leads the mind to wander, back to things said that weren’t meant, back to actions taken out of childish spite, back to times when we couldn’t avoid being our worst selves. Whomever the person, whatever the moment, those blemishes never seem to go away. The best one can hope is to learn from them, since they can never be forgotten. They’ll always be with you—no amount of ritualistic hand-washing can remove the damned spot.",12,214,27,"1,139","4,959",30/10/14,rated-9

The performances of the cast are impressive all throughout. The plot packs a good bunch of hints and twists, but the cluttered visual imagery does create some confusion. The first half uses effective rising action horror techniques, but as it went on, the overelaborate plot seems to lose the horror quality in favor of abrupt illusions and plot twists.

You know I once gave this a go and the loudness peaks annoyed the fuck out of me and ruined the otherwise incredible and incredibly creepy atmosphere so I turned it off around the one hour mark..Upon semi-revisiting the film, it didn’t feel that bad anymore, so I don’t know whether it was just the wrong day and I was a wimp or Kim Jee-woon is indeed a twat and the sound engineer deserves a dropkick but I adjusted and was forgiving.Last time around I only got my hands on a dubbed version though, so the dropkick deserving target could be located in Germany. Usually dubbed tracks sound flatter but alas.. who gives a shit at this point anymore? Because in the end A Tale Of Two Sisters lived up to its reputation as damn creepy horror film of both the supernatural and psychological kind and it’s also a terrifying, well-crafted look at a family falling apart. Kim Jee-woon’s staging of scenes and the pacing that unravels the mysteries of the characters at the exact right speed are a joy to watch and Lee Mo-gae’s cinematography moves with grace through beautifully designed sets and creates an eerie, thick atmosphere that is about as enjoyable as creepy can get. And there’s Im Su-jeong standout performance that is as magnetic as it’s fragile to the point of feeling fractured. Whatever a fractured performance actually is.I’m also pretty damn curious now how everything will fall into place upon a rewatch that will surely happen in the not so distant future. A Tale Of Two Sisters is one of the highlights in Kim Jee-woon’s mostly amazing ouvre.

She asks - Now dressed and leaving - The Spanish girl begins to bleed - She says her period' - Angels and Sailors; An American Prayer Kim Jee-Woon introduces us to Soo-mi (Su-jeong Lim - 'I'm a Cyborg, But That's OK, 2006'), a young girl of twenty two, perhaps with the help of a capacious room, tall windows, melancholic blue 'medical institution' walls and a psychologist - who looks as if he wants his shift to end soon so he may go home - asking Soo-mi all the questions mimicked by 'the film psychologist' throughout (unless it's Fassbender as Jung or Daffoe as 'He'); during which, he takes out a picture from his folder and reveals it to Soo-mi, and to the audience from far. We have Soo-mi raising her creepy, hair-covered face in the foreground with the good doctor and the photograph he produces in the back. The camera does not close-in on the photograph, making the viewer feel anxious. We're simply shown the photograph for a sense of distance to settle in. For detachment, abandonment (the blackened face) and psychosis to fill the atmosphere of a room furnished with two chairs, one table and three actors. That's five. It is also a clue to Soo-mi's secret. The film takes it's numbers seriously - as further observation(s) will tell. The first thing that the younger sister, Soo-Yeon (Geun-Young Moon) does after getting out of the car is run to the flower-patch and peel the 'Dogwoods' like Red Lotus (Hongryeon; as in the original title) to find the seed in it, to eat, eventually spitting it out because it's bitter. The sequence resembles the homo-neanderthals discovering new food, earth. Knowing it could be poisonous because other clans people have died doing shit like this.  This sequence has Soo-Mi. Soo-Yeon, Bae Moo-hyeon played with an impotent grace by the laconic and brilliant Kap-su-Kam (I Saw the Devil, 2010) and an unknown sedan with a three-box configuration (pillars). 'Three' box-configuration. Therefore we have four objects on the screen. The number four is all around us, like four walls, closing in on us, in the presence of the sisters. Trying to suffocate the space of the outdoors. Four steps of the stairs, two pair of legs, two swings. And when the sisters are light-hearted, the space although confined it its infinity expands to eight. Eight planks in the wooden fence on the porch. which changes to three as Soo-Jeon is not in the frame and the planks have lessened to three, with the father now in sight. The sisters, when together, are four or a never-ending cycle of eight. Like the kitchen. We can watch all four sides of the room. Then Kim Jee-Woon takes a shot of the ground from above, before the subtle haunting 'beneath' the kitchen sink. Now that we are completely trapped, the unsettling feeling and the assertive yet unsure Eun-joo (Jung-ah Yum) start to manifest themselves into pure terror in the viewers' minds.  Eun-Joo's number is three, like Soo-mi without her sister: setting the clock to 3:33; the twenty one steps she takes (not the camera) to welcome the sisters (three being the denominator here) and the shot of all three, the sisters and her while having a forced conversation. Plus the bedroom, where we see, the stepmother a bed and a mirror (serving a purpose) in one single, immaculately designed shot. Yet again, three. When the father enters the room, the number changes to four, losing the three in favour of the sisters, maybe?   The emphasis on the numbers is, perhaps to derail the viewer or do the complete opposite by restraining and forcefully flashing the scene with brilliant and exquisite cinematography, with amplified colours. Colours that show us the change in the moods of the character. A closer watch will also reveal that whenever Eun-Joo's (the stepmother) face is half-covered with hair she is either sharing an episode with Soo-mi or being cruel to Soo-Yeon or being manic. On the other hand when her full face is shown, Eun-Joo is unsure, doubting and questioning her own actions. Referring to the last lines in the first paragraph, note when Eun-Joo is watching 'blue' static noise on television, we can count; including the actor and the TV there is three other furniture in the room. Five. Has the metamorphosis begun?  The closet is green and it is a mystery, like the extremely deceitful Rorschach wallpaper. Like the ominous hue applied to the entire film. The performances are lovely and restrained, except when step mum does not take her pills. Coupled with the math and the haunted house meets underground-trance cinematography by Mo-Gaa Lee, 'A tale of Two sisters' is a masterpiece of calculated and a gorgeous, stunning and aesthetic direction by one of Korea's finest.  Once the numbers start to show up with other characters, it is then that we begin to note the crack forming in the otherwise water-tight psyche of the film. The house or Eun-Joo's past consumes her, after we see four frames behind a curtain. Out of place? yes. On the other hand Soo-mi's fate is decided in colour as we see her sitting on a pier and looking at the lush landscape beyond the shiny sea. Four. The daunting film has come full circle.

We get some real creepy stuff going on - real corner of your eye type stuff - but we're not going to find out what all this, as this is a real slow build that is going to creep up on us. There is a constant yearning to understand the backstory to this family - all of which become clearer on later reveals. I like the relationship of the sisters: one outgoing and outspoken, the other quiet and withdrawn. What a sick twisted bitch that step mother is though. She is actually quite unhinged - everyone around her is uncomfortable with her behaviour. Yeah, plenty of creepy happenings that make the hair on the back of your neck stand on end.  Yeah, this is turning more and more into a complete mind screw job. I wasn't expecting that twist, but then I should have, as later confirmed, I have seen the remake The Uninvited, but going into this blind, I was all the more open to any twists. The mind is a complicated thing; when it works fine it's great, and if it isn't working right, it can screw with you. Everything is up in the air. What is real and what is not? You start questioning the whole plot - what happened, what didn't? A fantastic film that touches on many themes such as loss, grief, guilt, all with a subtleness that slowly builds up towards the big reveals. Although most of my previous niggles about the film were explained by the big reveals, I still have one niggle - and it is minor - was the one plot point that bugged the hell out me at the time of seeing it: mainly the pivotal scene that kickstarts the whole story and the questionable actions/non-actions from characters. Everything about the film is top notch: the look, the acting, the directing, the camerawork - all of it help create a really creepy foreboding atmosphere.

In ten invasive minutes Peter Pscherkassky cuts up footage from the 1982 film The Entity into an onslaught of images that layer, repeat, twist and contort into something altogether inhuman despite containing some and being made by one. There’s also a narrative throughline, at least in the way it builds. The development of action is like a wave crashing into the shore, slowly building up energy as it increases in size and strength before descending in a maelstrom of directions and crushing anything in its wake, only to slowly recede back into its source until gone completely. Within that are short moments where things slow to a halt, revealing the unrepentant chaos to actually be in total control by the filmmaker.

The story is narrated by different characters, alternating points of view and past and present. This movie works the same way, an amazing accomplishment of abstract and surreal cinema. It's 10 fragmented minutes, but its imagery and use of the medium gives it a lot of power. A story of violence, horror and losing one's mind, open to interpretation, and made in a simple but terrifying and effective way.

Certainly this has the very central element of cubism of presenting subject from multiple angles at the same time but it also shares the same visual depth of the works from Picasso and others in how it forces one's eyes to analyse every visual aspect as clearly as they can whether or not there is any clarity to be found.

Tscherkassky himself is a very interesting filmmaker. He essentially embraces the artifice of film - actual film - and so uses found footage and all of the defects that can be inflicted upon it to create his own cinematic language. There are two main effects, or achievements, of this cinematic language. The first is tantamount to the montage theorised and demonstrated by Soviet filmmakers such as Kuleshov, Pudovkin, Vertov and Eisenstein. In such, Tscherkassky utilises juxtaposition to create meaning and construct a cinematic space. But, instead of, in the simplest terms, jumping between different images as you see in Soviet montage films, Tscherkassky breaks his frame apart, double exposes, twists and folds the film to contrast one image to another. However, in Outer Space this juxtaposition is done minimalistically (in comparison to more recent films such as The Exquisite Corpus) so that the second effect of his cinematic language can be capitalised on. By contorting his frame, breaking apart his image and film, Tscherkassky produces an effect that is somewhat similar to a jump scare. Instead of there being one flash of an image that's punctuated with a huge musical beat, there is a constant flash of images (something like that seen in French Impressionist films such as Napoleon) emphasised by a cacophonous barrage of sound. In such, you get this blinding or epileptic effect in which you're almost attacked with light and sound that attempts to elongate the effects of something like a jump scare which will just go BANG or FLASH... more from:danielslackdsu.blogspot.co.uk/2017/02/the-house-of-ghostsouter-space-physical.html",1,6,0,192,225,21/2/17,0

If this film continued on this pace for a feature length run-time then I would have no choice but to rank it right along side the likes of Man With a Movie Camera as the best of whatever you call this type of film.

And I think that's the key to appreciating something like this, to see it as you would hear a loop steadily changing every time around.

In fact, most of the time nothing really scares. But holy shit, this sure did. It is a ten minute assault of your senses, with everything being tested and leaving you thoroughly disturbed. The footage is taken from the 1980 horror film The Entity, and Peter Tscherkassky takes an already existing film and makes it into a terrifying portrait of insanity. The editing here is some of the most stylised yet some of the best I've ever seen, as it invokes a sense of frantic hopelessness that horror is supposed to make you feel, but I find rarely does. Here is a film that makes you feel truly alone with something nonsensical that you don't understand, yet are powerless to stop for that very reason. It's almost a Lovecraftian piece in the way that it examines these themes, but granted in a very different way. Outer Space (still no idea why it's called that) is a ridiculously awesome piece of art that needs to be seen to be believed.

With Outer Space, Tscerkassky explores the underbelly of the cinematic miracle, the terrifying ontological implications of film itself. With the brilliant twinned formal approach of manipulating preexisting footage and highlighting the materiality of film, Tscerkassky foregrounds the ways the cinematic apparatus functions - and how it breaks down. Bodies are ripped from reality, imprisoned within the indexical image; time is dismembered and rearranged as montage destroys, twists and perverts. This is an inherently violent procedure (one need only look askance at some of the most banal filmic terminology to notice its sadism: shot, cut, splice, dissolve), a procedure that points out the instability of our own subjectivity. Outer Space compounds the existential terror that film represents by exploding its form. Beginning with images from the 1981 horror film The Entity, Tscerkassky recontextualizes, superimposes, dims, flickers and distorts the footage. Working with an expansive widescreen palette, he shows us not only the images of The Entity, but the guts of the film too, exposing the edges of the frame, sprockets and the bumps and scratches on the soundtrack. In short, Tscerkassky eviscerates the films, flays it and lays it bare.

A story of a murder/assault, that could still be derived from such insane, incomprehensible, editing. I assumed the film in this was original, and actually found the entire work to be more powerful when I read it was footage from an older film.  The film starts in one perspective, feeling like the brain, in its final living moments, processing what just happened to it, and realizing it’s dying. The film then dies itself, ripping itself to shreds, and only scattered horror remaining; until it all rebuilds. The final perspective feels more like the truth, or the killers perspective, still in a manic and crazy delivery, until it ends. And when it ended I finally realized I wasn’t breathing. This simultaneously left me in a catatonic state induced by anxiety (the sound design is incredibly effecting), and also in a state of deep admiration at the technical achievement, while also prompting much thought about the nature, and structure of film. This as an individualistic piece is thrilling, something truly unique, that I’ll never forget, but when you can incorporate such a sequence into a narrative film, and it adds and doesn’t distract... I think you’ve got the power of cinema in your hands. 2001, Tree of Life, Episode 8 of The Return, are all examples that immediately come to mind. There’s something about cinema breaking down walls, whilst also engaging a narrative, that’s so appealing to me, but the fact this is just a stand-alone short takes nothing away from the power.

All horror is in essence about violation of space and this may well be the purest instance of horror in the medium of the moving image. It concisely and viscerally merges all three modes - Physical (crossing the safety of the home, violating the sanctity of the body), Psychological (the intrusion of uncertainty into a certain space - fear) and Metaphysical/Cinematic (the violation of the cinematic frame, conventions torn asunder, The Entity ripped a new one). Well, merges isn't entirely accurate, because that suggests a smooth communion rather than the obliterating physical, mental, cinematic static of the outer spaces (outside the home, the source of fear, the exterior of the frame).",2,8,2,324,391,14-Feb-17,0

Tscherkassky takes this footage from another film and creates something completely new and different, legitimately making it his own genuine work. He does this often in his films, using footage from another film and editing it into something else. A great example besides this one, is what he does to The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in his experimental short Instructions for a Light and Sound Machine, transforming its genre completely from a western into a Greek tale of tragedy. Outer Space is one of the most effective avant garde pieces of cinema that I have ever seen. In one essence it is completely chaotic in its destruction of editing, lighting, and splicing. In another, it does what many avant garde films have difficulty doing, and that is conveying a sense of a story in its images. Therefore, what is artistically demonstrated in its mutation of film still holds the main attributes that cinema requires.  It has an increasingly tense atmosphere, building up the suspense for the viewer by only showing them glimpses of a nightmarish fantasy. The viewer has no clue what is suppose to be real or not as coherency is no longer needed for the experimental genre. As the film progresses, we begin to see the cyclic nature of evil at work. This is no longer the ghost story that the actual footage was filmed for. Tscherkassky has transformed it into a haunting inner battle of one woman coping with her mental frailty. The multiple spliced images of the same woman in one shot represents multiple points in her personality struggling for superiority. Tscherkassky's cinema is always interesting, because it raises the debate of whether his films, utilizing footage from other films, are truly his own. All one has to do is to watch this short, and I think it would be a very evident answer. There is no longer any resemblance to The Entity. Tscherkassky with the help of his tools, an experimental imagination for destruction, and a darkroom, gave birth to this wonderful monstrosity and that's just the way it is.",4,86,2,180,"3,512",20-Mar-13,rated-8

They both revel in being weird and surreal. Tongue Tied is even pretty decent at being weird. There's creative imagery and good editing at least. But man, oh man, is it easy to tell the difference between a poser and a pro, and Cyrus is the epitome of a fucking poser. Peter Tscherkassky is a pro. Tscherkassky is a found footage filmmaker, although I mean that in a literal sense rather than in the 'Paranormal-Activity-Blair-Witch-Project-Found-Footage-Framing-Device' kind of way. He works with actual footage he finds, and in the case of Outer Space, footage from the 1981 horror film The Entity. Tscherkassky took that film and the scrap footage left on the cutting room floor and then went fucking bananas on it. It's been a while since I've watched Outer Space, and that fact means it's impact has not lessened. The editing is astounding, truly inspiring for anyone even remotely interested in the field. It's all physically done with film in a darkroom, and this adds to the grungy, distorted vibe the whole film gives off. What is Outer Space about? Well, you could give it a plot line, in that it's about a woman entering a house and fighting something. However, it isn't really about that. It's about itself. You see the edges of the film, the reels crackle and distort, before leading into a loud cacophonous assault of the senses. It's a 10 minute trance that seems to never end, a dance with the devil in cinematic form. Calling Outer Space scary is selling it incredibly short. It Follows is scary. The Babadook is scary. Outer Space is terror-inducing, a panic attack on screen. It has no sense, it has no plot, it has no reason. It's an anarchistic, nihilistic field of complete unfiltered insanity. Outer Space channels the feeling of a nightmare; it embraces it and nurtures it. Like the main character in the film, we keep trying to run away, to get away from the torture we willingly put ourselves through. Put we can't, of course. You can't stop watching Outer Space before it ends. It grabs your head, pulls your eyes open and makes you sit there until it's good and done with you. I still can't praise Outer Space enough. It's a short film to beat all other short films, for me. A concept, an idea, a fucked up brainwave that is genuinely like torture on film. It really is a film you need to see, just to experience it.

I couldn't really get into this one unfortunately, but I do appreciate what it's attempting to go for, as well as what it seems to be eliciting out of other viewers. ""Horror"" is a feeling, it takes different things to get that feeling out of different people, and with some all you need to do is strip the feeling down to its bare bones, reversed audio, pictures that feel like they're chipping away just as you're seeing them. The short as a whole looks cool, I can say that, and it is neat seeing how other media can be repurposed by someone else to make something that is completely their own. In some cases, that new thing can become even more admired than what it originally took from.

The kind of against the grain character turn that is supposed to give beloved movie stars Oscars didn't quite pan out for him and the movie bombed. So, soon after this, it was ""MY WIFE MY FAMILY"" and no more taking chances until Bob Zemeckis asked him to play a bad guy in a summer blockbuster Hitchcock ripoff... And that's a shame. It's a shame he didn't keep on taking chances because a movie like this really displayed his chops. And it's a shame this movie failed at the box office because it is a complex and very interesting adventure, with bold confrontational ideas. Paul Schrader's witty screenplay is adapted from a Paul Theroux novel, but it is very much a Paul Schrader work. He uses the framework of Theroux's novel to work out his own recurring demons with regards to his apocalyptic vision of Reagan's America and the traumas of his oppressive religious upbringing. That juicy stuff is all here and filtered through Peter Weir's poetic directorial vision...a crisp point of view, enhanced by typically stunning John Seale cinematography and a spare but effective Murice Jarre synth-based score.  The intensity of the performances brings these characters to life. That, coupled with the lush jungle setting, makes this an extremely vivid and pulsating film...full of sharp images and haunting moments. You get sucked in and experience the journey along with the characters...breathing in the fresh chlorophyl in the air and feeling the humid heat searing through your skin. Some critics, then and now, expressed a problem with Harrison Ford's character. That he was an obnoxious, stubborn and self-righteous fool and it was impossible to like him. Yes. Their description of him is accurate. Their expectation that we are meant to sympathize with him is idiotic. Perhaps some people would connect with the man's socially progressive ideals...but you can't really root for a man who would sacrifice the comfort and happiness of his loved ones just to prove something to himself. That is a troubled and selfish man, not a hero. And this is not a hero's journey. It is a statement about the futility of utopia in a world doomed to perpetual progress at the expense of purity. In that sense, Harrison Ford's character is perfect at encapsulating both the good and bad of this world view. Helen Mirren is wonderful as his wife...with him lovingly until she can no longer live in denial; and River Phoenix provides a strong moral center for the everyman, allowing us to see this story through his eyes. It's a wonderful film. A great film that deserves to be considered an American classic.

Turns out it was a good decision as the book is a thrilling read - a brilliant, detailed character study central to a modern post-colonial myth that channels the spirit of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. So it was with the novel fresh in mind that I tracked down Peter Weir's 1986 adaptation. The film doesn't miss any major plot points but it feels like punches are being pulled all the way through, right up to the ending, which is the biggest departure from the book and softens what should be the bitterest of blows. Here, Allie Fox meets his end with a resigned smile and drifts peacefully off to the netherworld accompanied by the plucked harps of cherubs as River Phoenix's calm narration wraps things up in an gently optimistic bow. In the book, Allie has degenerated into a raving lunatic, who drags his invalid body off to be eaten alive by vultures, leaving his family to an uncertain fate on the desolate Mosquito Coast, under the sun's unwavering glare. The characterization is similarly hit and miss. Harrison Ford looks like the kind of rugged American outlaw you'd want playing Allie Fox, but he misses the extremities of the character. Whether that's down to Paul Schrader's writing or his own inability to plumb the depths of the character's soul, I'm not sure. In Theroux's novel, his genius for self-sufficiency is matched only by his megalomania, a trickle of paranoia that gradually becomes a river and engulfs his mind (Charlie's venture inside Fat Boy's guts and the terrifying glimpse he gets of the inner workings of his father's mind - a pivotal moment conceptually, if not structurally, in the book is absent here). That volatility, his proneness to sulk, frequent lapses into verbal violence and misanthropic ranting only occasionally emerge; in the main, Ford plays him with unflappable equanimity. In the book, from the moment Jeronimo explodes, sending his dreams up in smoke and poisoning his jungle idyll, Allie is a man literally and figuratively paddling upstream, vainly fighting the current as he's pulled ever downward. Where Theroux gave us a far-reaching commentary on the fall of man, an atavistic journey into darkness, here we have what often feels like little more than an extended family holiday where shit's gone seriously south. The rest of the casting is OK - River Phoenix does a good job of playing Charlie in the beginning, but as time wears on, his character doesn't really develop - he doesn't fully convey the contempt and disillusionment Charlie feels towards his father, which at the end of the day, is what it's all about: a violent coming of age, nascent Oedpial drives coming to fruition. The twins barely feature, Jerry is a brat (he is in the novel too, but the humiliations he's forced to suffer at Allie's hands render him a lot more sympathetic). Mother, played by Helen Mirren, is one of the better performances; you do get at least some sense of her forbearance but also the lengths she will go to to protect her kids - even from Allie, if it comes to it; though again, this comes out much stronger in the novel. Of the more minor characters, Conrad Roberts is a standout as Mr. Haddy, and conveys his initial reverence for 'fadder' and also his increasing doubts about his efficacy. Haddy's critical intervention, saving the Foxs' lives by providing them with spark plugs and gasoline for the outboard motor, risking his own life in the process, makes it into the film, but as with everything else, it's glossed over somewhat. John Seale's cinematography provide some beautiful shots of lush jungle fauna and evoke a real sense of place (and displacement), with location shooting in Belize standing in for Honduras. With the exception of the storm at Brewer's Lagoon (inexplicably relocated to the coast and never mentioned by name), the ferocity of the jungle is subdued. In the book, the despair the family feels at their inability to tame the land a second time is all too palpable, just like the way it strains at the last threads of sanity holding them together. Honduras (or Belize) is too scenic; while they might be great in a travelogue, there's a distancing effect to all the overhead shots of lush vegetation and placid rivers below when you really want to be in the thick of the green inferno, sweating it out with the Foxes, rather than observing them from a safe distance. It needed to be more savage. It's probably not a good idea to watch an adaptation straight after reading a book, especially one as good as The Mosquito Coast; I made the same mistake with Dune. The urge to play spot the difference is too great. All the same, I don't think my critical faculties are too impaired to say that this is only an average film, regardless. Schrader's script sticks doggedly close to the text of the book - there's barely a line in the film that wasn't on the page - and it efficiently plots a line between the key loci, but somehow the essence is missing. It's all too safe, too family friendly; a sanitized version of what is at its heart a re-telling of the myth of Icarus; Allie Fox, the man who would be God (greater, because God was just a jobbing plumber), who could make ice from fire but whose hubris saw him scalped by the very scavengers he abhorred.

Now he was gone, and I wasn't afraid to love him any more. And the world seemed limitless.” I’ve decided to watch a movie I haven’t seen from one of my favorite directors of all-time. Peter Weir’s films always has this adventurous feel to them and the story subject matter he chooses to direct his films on have always grabbed my attention. As I expected, this film had the best of my interest. The story is about a American family man who is fed up with the American life and is obsessed with the idea that America is on the brink of collapsing so he wants to move to another country. He decides to build a Eden in the jungle away from society so that he and his family won’t become what he fears most. This story wouldn’t of worked without the amazing performances coming from all the leads and all the supporting performances. Hellen Mirren is beautiful as ever and does a splendid job playing the most loyal wife I’ve ever seen on film. I wish she had more screen time along with the late River Phoenix who plays the oldest son who is proud and devoted to his father’s motives. He holds the family together when the parents are not around. Such a strong performance from River BUT this is Harrison Ford’s movie. He gives his best performance ever in my opinion. He brings so much charisma and charm to this character. You can see the passion in his performance when playing this role. He bursts with so much emotion when creating ideas and inventing stuff that you just want to root him on. But when things doesn’t go his way you can see his pride and ego gets in the way and you can see the disgust and the anger he leashes out on his family. His character is likable at first then very unlikable by the end. That’s great acting. The flaws are there though. The problem with this story is it’s already been used many times before. There’s not much narrative towards the end because it becomes predictable. This is a character study inside the mind of a arrogant genius and towards the end there wasn’t much left to study. It’s very slow paced as well when it didn’t need to be. Nonetheless, Peter Weir is a master at turning novels into movies and it shows here. Performances are strong and believable. As always in Mr. Weir’s films the majestic location and prolific cinematography makes this film adventurous. Overall this was well worth the ride.",2,15,0,92,886,26-Feb-20,rated-6

I’ve decided to review a film I’ve never seen before. Vaguely hearing about “the mosquito coast” over the years. It’s always been in the back of my mind to give this one a watch.So tonight I took a gamble and put it on and I was gladly satisfied when this film didn’t turn out to be garbage.   Harrison ford plays his one of the least likeable dads on the face of the earth. A guy who is so self absorbed with his own obsessions he moves his whole family to the jungle. Just so he can make some wacky inventions. It’s one great big adventure. Right...  I just can’t understand why they would write  the hero of this film to have such a stubborn, arrogant, hateful on screen persona.  Whilst also giving the character little on screen character development. I just felt there was little character arc. He just remains a prick for the whole duration of the film.  Now that’s my only bone to pick with this film. Everything else was delightful . John Seale’s cinematography in some scenes is inspiring. Peter Weir really has created complex look into a family against the odds in the wilderness with such ease. The film also moves with a pretty quick pace.  For some this film won’t bite but for others who go into it with an open mind it will be a classic for life.  Highly recommend",6,3,0,10,20,22-Sep-20,rated-9

The first and only time I've seen THE MOSQUITO COAST was a quarter of a century ago. I rented it on VHS when I was around 12 (ca 1988). Even though it was hardly a kids movie I still remember vividly how I immediately had to re-watch it a couple of more times before I had to return it! So apparently it stirred something in me, even at such a young age. I never saw it again until I bought it on DVD a few years ago, but I have yet to see this copy. Partly I think it is because I want to keep the magic stuck in the back of my head from 1988, and leave it at that. Also, I fear that it is not Peter Weir's strongest film, despite a fantastic cast and a screenplay by none other than Paul Schrader, and I am deathly afraid of being disappointed. I want to stick with my childhood memory. As a result it wouldn't be fair to write a review now more than 25 years later. If I had to rank it I would have to give it ""five pair of a 12-year-old's bewitched eyes."" Instead, I'll get into the man who put this film together; PETER WEIR. You see, I love Peter Weir. All his movies seem to have a unique flavor, almost dreamlike quality to them. Sometimes this Weir-touch is extremely distinct, like in the remarkable and eerie PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK. Other times it is more subtle, but it always seems to be there, just breathing below the surface. The man knows how to build atmosphere and he always leaves me wanting more. Like the greatest of storytellers he doesn't need explosions or special effects to crawl under your skin. And while he might include symbolism, making his movies extremely poetic, they still never come off as pretentious. That in itself is a remarkable feat. In a typical Weir-creation, Warmth and Humanity is key. His movies may boast of great visuals, but his driving force is always the People. Unlike certain contemporaries he doesn't stand on the rooftops looking down on us, shouting: ""CAN YOU GUESS WHAT I AM DOING!? CAN YOU SEE WHAT I AM SHOVING IN YOUR FACE!?""  Take a modern-day ""darling"" of critics (!) and audiences like Darren Aronofsky. He'll take the most extraordinary stories (NOAH, THE FOUNTAIN) and masturbate them all over us, and it's like we see his brain-cells at work right there on the screen, we sense the calculating and the scheming behind every frame.  On the other hand Peter Weir will breathe life into the most mundane and make us care more for a single supporting character than we would all characters combined in most other films out there. To Peter Weir - just like in real life - Less is More. He gladly takes us along for the ride but the film isn't about him or what HE can do, it is about all of US. And after a lifetime of enjoying his films I still can't explain how his creative brain works. I am just extremely grateful his movies exist.  Considering this (and his strong filmography) Weir isn't just a rare FIVE STAR director. He could be the most underrated - not to mention selfless - filmmaker working today; an actual champion of on-screen Humanitas!",10,2,1,32,85,2/11/14,rated-10

An irony, because it contains what is easily his very best performance despite being the most aggressively unlikeable character he's ever played. Ford makes Allie Fox a domineering ideologue with sound intentions, but whose practices essentially espouse exactly what he laments in American society. Especially for this time in his career, such a role was certainly a risk for Ford, and while the film failed to yield short-term success, this - and to a lesser extent Witness (1985), also by Weir - enabled the megastar to branch out significantly with his later choices. The film isn't quite perfect as it attempts to explore the tribulations Fox is putting his family through with his zealous crusading, but somewhat sidelines them and ends up resembling some kind of pseudo-character study fearful to probe the genius mind of its unstable lead too far, worried he might realise it. But Paul Schrader's script successfully embraces the manifold ironies at play in the story, and Ford is unforgettable.",1,6,0,417,"1,126",11-Sep-20,rated-8

In other words, it's a Peter Weir film through and through. I've been watching his films all my life, and whether we're talking about this or Gallipoli or The Truman Show or Fearless or Master and Commander or The Way Back, I haven't figured out how he can root his films in such precise physical details and still have them feel ethereal, almost translucent. Purists have carped about how Weir and his screenwriter Paul Schrader have softened author Paul Theroux's original novel, but they do so only so Weir can make the story his own. Theroux is attracted/repulsed by Allie Fox, a racist genius who uproots his family to Central America, starts a cult in support of his own technological acumen, and dies horribly for his efforts. But Weir? Weir sees something admirable in Fox (Harrison Ford), in his dreams to build a utopia from of American interference, and he wants us to share that beautiful, foolhardy goal. Without ignoring the very real perils present in both 1980s Central America, Weir gives us something that feels, in its best moments, like an idealized gloss on Swiss Family Robinson. The Fox family community looks like a Rube Goldberg contraption come to life, and everybody (from River Phoenix's sensitive eldest child to Helen Mirren's quietly supportive mother) pulls in support of this dream. And all captured under the lens of John Seale's gorgeously tactile cinematography. You feel the heat radiating off of the jungle. When circumstances turn - and they do, and for the worst - the film shifts tone from high adventure to something resembling an elegy. Allie's mania in the last third feels less reflective of mental illness (as Theroux suggests in the novel) and more of his desperation to reclaim perfection. And holy fuck, Harrison Ford. This is the most important film he ever made; it marks the great ""Before/After"" divide, in that he was never this good before or after. It's such a singular fusion of Movie Star and Character Actor: we get so much of Allie's idiosyncrasies and foibles filtered through Ford's inimitable style (the scene where Allie jabbers unintelligibly as he chainsaws through a tree is his career highlight). No other actor could play this part quite this way, and Ford never would again. You sense the failure of the film broke him - would that we appreciated what he was doing in '86. We could have had more performances this exciting. Maybe that's the real tragedy.",3,4,2,77,174,26-Apr-18,rated-9

This is Harrison Ford like you have never seen him before. He is super raw in this performance and really goes for it. It doesn't always work, but he gives a good performance and the second best of the movie. River Phoenix though, he steals the show for me. Such a natural performer and really played off Harrison well. I wonder if this movie helped get him the young Indiana Jones role. I also wish that Helen Mirren was given more to do in the movie, maybe this was just too early on in her career, but she is an all time talent and was underused. The movie also though, it did struggle to ever get me to fully invest in the whole thing.

But with the perspective of time, it has to be considered a formidable movie in its own right, much more Apocalypse Now -or Fitzcarraldo- than Witness. Paul Schrader’s screenplay is as brilliant as it’s personal. But once more, it’s Peter Weir’s touch that makes The Mosquito Coast unique now, as it was then. Weir masterfully evoques the encounter and quiet clash of co-existing civilizations, and between man and nature. And he enhances his vision making the most of the cast, particularly turning his star, Harrison Ford, into a fascinating but unreliable leader, a brilliant inventor and family man lost in his own obsessions, leading him into madness and risking the lives of his family in the way to a better world. A great addition to the filmography of one of the better directors still in active. La Costa de los Mosquitos fue vista en su momento como un exponente desconcertante y menor de la colaboración entre Weir y Ford.

El guión de Paul Schrader es tan brillante como personal. Pero de nuevo, es el toque de Peter Weir el que convierte a La Costa de los Mosquitos en algo tan único ahora como entonces. Weir evoca de forma maestra el encuentro y el choque silencioso entre civilizaciones en coexistencia, y entre el Hombre y la Naturaleza. Y perfecciona su visión sacando el máximo provecho a su reparto, en particular convirtiendo a la estrella Harrison Ford en un personaje fascinante y un líder poco fiable, un inventor y hombre de familia brillante , perdido en sus propias obsesiones, dirigiéndolo hacia la locura y arriesgando a su familia por el camino, por la quimera de un mundo mejor.

(SPOILER) As with nearly every Peter Weir film, the evocative sound design and atmosphere are wonderful, and the story of a man's descent into madness features what may be Harrison Ford's best performance. It's jarring to see Ford play such an unlikable, delusional character, and he's brilliant. In fact, the whole cast is outstanding: Ford, Helen Mirren, and River Phoenix, who should be one of our greatest current living actors (sigh). Mirren doesn't get a whole lot to do in the supportive wife role, but Phoenix is very good as Ford's oldest son, who's alternately in awe and terrified by his father. ""Mosquito Coast"" is also a reminder that Peter Weir is one of the great filmmakers. This ranks right alongside ""Picnic at Hanging Rock,"" ""Master and Commander,"" ""Witness"" and ""The Truman Show"" as one of Weir's finest films. I saw some comparisons to ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God,"" and those proved surprisingly apt. Rather than watching the leader of an army descend into madness, here it's the head of a family, which provides for an interesting and at times more personal dynamic. I can't say this is as great as ""Aguirre,"" (few things are), but it's an excellent film.",4,4,0,664,547,30-Aug-14,rated-9

As they head off to Belize, Allie has plans to build a new society from scratch and with that, he acts and behaves strangely and his descent to madness threatens to hurt the ones he loves, as he goes on to confront the Reverend.

Which Ford does well in, as he acquits himself in such a complex role, and one where the audience doesn't have much sympathy towards Allie; sadly, the same isn't said for the actual movie, wherein its almost 2-hr run-time is bogged down by what is a grating and drawn-out narrative and an almost total lack of drama and genuine hostility being generated, although the tension between Allie Fox, his wife, played by Helen Mirren, and son by the late River Phoenix, though whilst this wasn't lacking, this should have been far more potent and consistent throughout.  The pacing of this film utterly drags it down, although given it takes a long while for the characters to recognise that Allie's ego has become way too big, this in itself prolongs the story's agony further, but without much that is revered. Harrison Ford's Allie Fox is a terrible person who lacks any empathy, whatsoever, especially for a so-called protagonist, who is really an anti-hero, and he is a total douche for the entirety of the flick, ranting and raving his way, which will irritate a lot of people who will watch this. & what's with Helen Mirren's character being called 'Mother'?

And despite Peter Weir's efforts and Ford's performance, which is probably the best I have seen of his by far, as he goes down a darker route - thus displaying a range of acting that is unheard of from him -, the film itself, through Weir, just doesn't have enough tools to pull it off, as he works within such a confined and hectic jungle environment - and still, he doesn't go far and beyond to truly impress. This felt like a film that is okay at best, though it just practically sits there, without making too much noise and hot air; it most certainly should have been way, way better.  The Mosquito Coast is a film that would have won plaudits by many, not just critics, but, and ultimately, the execution is just way off.

The world around him disappears. He is so lost in his own headspace that he is beyond redemption. He doesn't realize he has doomed his entire family. It is that tipping point where bitter intellectualism turns sycophancy for wayward ideology. Some may describe it as secularism as religion. Religious ideologues seek to mislead through false empowerment -- here the secular ideologue uses guilt as the fuel for his followers. It is zealotry via condescension. A very fine film that can be compared to many works that came before and after it. Thusly, it is recommended in particular for readers of Kipling, Bowles, Conrad and, of course, Theroux, whose work the film is based upon.

We cackled at it a bunch, along with the similarly problematic The Gods Must Be Crazy, but were too young to grasp any of its thematic concerns. A more recent corollary to this film came thirty years later with Ex Machina, which also concerns a genius inventor living ""off the grid"" and obsessively chasing an imagined purity until said pursuit unmakes him. In that film, the victims of the inventor's ambition are supposedly synthetic women. In The Mosquito Coast, it is Allie Fox's family: particularly his wife, whose enthusiasm and support for her manic husband gradually erode into Stockholm syndrome. Though she's played by Helen Mirren, both the dialogue and the end credits refer to her only as ""Mother"", a chilling and thematically apt dehumanization. The Mosquito Coast doesn't interrogate its protagonist's racism and colonialism as much as I'd like, but it does depict his obsession with purity as a fetish for the livelihoods of indigenous people living in non-industrial societies, which is pretty decent for 1986, a whole six years before Ford's most famous screen dad, Sean Connery, headlined the fabulously racist white-man-saves-jungle-tribes fantasia Medicine Man, to say nothing of Raiders or Temple of Doom.

Maybe not unique for director Peter Weir, who is known for his slow and contemplative dramas, but definitely unique for star Harrison Ford. No action, no fight scenes, and no archaeological digs. This is a straight drama and Ford was rewarded by it being the only film he starred in to lose money. Playing eccentric inventor Allie Fox, The Mosquito Coast depicts Allie taking his family to Belize where he buys a small village. Fed up with American life and the perceived failure of it as a society, he sees the small village of Jeronimo as a paradise where they can start over. Unfortunately, things go haywire as he gets more-and-more erratic in his behavior. A slow descent into madness, Ford turns in possibly his best acting performance in the film and it is a film with various thematic layers courtesy of Weir. One of the most readily apparent themes at play in the film is the perceived failure of the American dream. Winding down to the point where people buy things they do not need and sells things to people who also do not need them, commercialization has superseded ambition. Driving past migrant workers in America, Fox laments to his two sons - Charlie (River Phoenix) and Jerry (Jadrien Steele) - that he has no idea why they keep coming here. They work their asses off and for what? Nothing but abject poverty. Constantly complaining about the way in which America has spiraled downward into being practically a parody of itself, Allie Fox is a man who eventually proves just how hard it is to build a society. In Jeronimo, he builds his ice machine that produces ice from fire and provides preservation for food and air conditioning, but his greed and pride lead him to abusing his machine to kill intruders. Backfiring, he winds up quickly destroying his settlement. Viewed in comparison with the theme of the failed American dream, Fox essentially answers his own question. He works hard to build himself up with no expectation of monetary reward. He does it because he has to and he views this place as his best chance for happiness. For immigrants, their reasons are very much the same. Unfortunately, infrastructure of the country they arrive in winds up blowing up in their face and knocking them back down to square one. Early in the film, Allie also rants about the world. Stating that war has changed immeasurably, he believes that no longer is either side entirely innocent in war. Rather, both sides are different shades of evil. This belief comes to fruition when he battles Reverend Spellgood (Andre Gregory). Bringing Christianity to the area via his missionary, he and Allie do battle and the Reverend accuses Allie of being a communist. Bringing Allie's villagers to his settlement and unafraid to use a gun and kill people, the Reverend is hardly a good man. His own daughter, who befriends Charlie, hardly even likes him. Yet, Allie himself is a murderer and a dangerous psychopath. For both, they felt the call to come out to this area in Belize - the Reverend because of God and Allie because of his rejection of American society - yet they quickly discover there is not enough room for the both of them. Mirroring war, they both quickly divide their settlements and stay the hell away from one another and neither are particularly good people with both exacting violence on one another and their settlements. As is clear, communism, the red scare, and nuclear holocaust also play a key thematic role in the film. Accused of being a communist, Allie also tells his children that America was destroyed by a nuclear bomb after previously warning that nuclear holocaust was on its way. In the mid-1980s, the red scare may not have been nearly as prevalent as in the 1950s, but it certainly was still around and Allie plays on this paranoia with his own children. Unfortunately for him, he brings nuclear holocaust to Jeronimo with his inventions that pollute the water. The end result being that it is not machines or the warheads we need to be wary of, but the people in control of them. His machine would not have exploded had he not used it for his own nefarious purposes out of greed, pride, and anger. In essence, he was the reason for hellfire coming to his settlement and opened himself up to punishment for his own inclination to fall into excess. Similarly, nuclear holocaust would not be a fear if it were not for the people willing to use them for nefarious purposes. Nuclear energy could be used for good just as his machine could be used for good, but its purpose is perverted and used to promote various agendas or criminal enterprises. The film also explores racism. One of the nicest men in the film is Mr. Haddy (Conrad Roberts). Panamanian, he takes the Fox's to their new village and gives them food and gas when they need it, while also helping them build up their society. Yet, Allie refers to him and the nearby Indians as ""savages"" for the way in which they live. Naturally, he lives exactly the same way. He is a hypocrite and lacking self-awareness, while still looking to feel superior to others. His own racism mirrors America's in the way that, in spite of him being on level playing ground with the ""savages"", he still looks down on them for doing exactly what he does: anything to survive. No matter how kind they are, he is unable to look past his own prejudice and ego to admit that they are good people that have shown him and his family nothing but kindness. In the end, everything would have been fine if he had listened to Haddy, but his own arrogance and pride proved to be the cause of his own demise as he was unwilling to change his prejudiced views. For modern day America, this certainly seems to be the case again with many calling for immigrants and minorities to ""go home"", in spite of the benefits they bring to society. Just as with whites, there are good and bad people of every race, but those who are prejudiced lump them all into being a group of ""savages"", making it easier to discriminate against them and look past the good they bring. Thematically important, The Mosquito Coast may be too slow for some, but it is undeniably riveting to watch unfold. Thrilling, dramatic, and horrifying, Allie Fox's descent into pure insanity and into a dangerous man is hard to watch and a compelling character study of a man who subtly becomes the evil he was warning his kids about in the beginning.",7,22,0,894,"1,998",24-Feb-17,rated-8

In fact it hadn't lasted for more than five minutes. The movie in question was a Peter Weir film, Green Card. Maybe it's a gem of a film, I don't know. Since that time in 1990 I haven't revisited it and probably won't. The explanation for walking out is simple, though. It had nothing to do with Peter Weir or Green Card. My buddy and I had simply entered the wrong theater. We were late, there was no one at the door(s) and we just picked the wrong one. I remember all this vividly, but somehow can't remember which film we actually had tickets for. I mention this because I love some of Peter Weir's films. Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli, Master and Commander, The Truman Show are all favorites of mine. Several others as well. It's a bit strange then that somehow I had missed out on The Mosquito Coast up until now. Not a bad film, but not among his best either. Almost all the time during the perils of the jungle I was thinking - this is a lighter version of Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo - even if the Allie Fox of this film may have a greater purpose behind his actions than did Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald. Initially, at least. Later the jungle gets to him too and his behavior changes.Lighter? Not entirely so. Weir tries to depict a deeply disturbed and complicated man. The reasons behind Allie's actions are hazy at first, but - it's not a back to nature thing as he initially claims. He wants to reboot civilization. He sees himself as a savior, and wants absolutely no assistance in becoming one, no one to share it with. Certainly no competition from the more traditional savior, Missionary Spellgood. This ego process could have been developed more. It wouldn't perhaps have made Allie Fox more likeable, but it could have benefited the film as a whole. I ended up not really caring what happened to him. It didn't seem to me as he was fighting any form of a good cause. Or any cause, for that matter. Like his family I just wanted the expedition to be over. The film is far from being a failure, but it's simply not engaging enough as a story.",4,4,4,232,"1,116",2-Nov-14,rated-6

The entire family has a purpose and Mirren's voice of reason and the children's innocence and call for justice and love clash against the protagonist's extreme idealization of the establishment of a ""flawless"" utopia in the middle of God's untouched, perfectly balanced creation. His hatred towards God has the most natural consequences: hating himself, living eternally frustrated, considering himself superior to Him, and finding the flaws in everything he didn't create. His hypocrisy reaches such degree that we stumble upon irony: he first buys Jeronimo with American money, and everything backlashes. Even the biggest empires have fallen. The reason why I like this film marginally over Witness (1985) is the profoundness of its spiritual and social statements (the scene where he gets his mouth shot with Exodus 5 is golden). The impressionistic lens portraying Belize never makes us lose focus on the characters, and the exocitization of the landscapes and culture is never harmful towards its locals just like the cultural inaccuracies in Jakarta never harmed the portrayal of Indonesians: one would have to be ignorant to think that the portrayal of ""foreigners"" in film is necessarily a generalization of the director, like thinking that Brazil is a gigantic, crime-infested and miserable slum just because City of God (2002) and Carandiru (2003) told me so. Bewildering and ambitious, the auteur is brave enough to take a shot at Herzog's utopian and maniac adventures, a strong spirit that was still present in Herzog's craft and mind since the masterful Cobra Verde (1987) would be released one year after. It works wonders for two beautiful hours, and this has arguably Ford's best acting of his entire career. 85/100",4,26,2,209,"7,821",22-Apr-20,rated-8

It was a critical and box office failure upon release, but there is a lot to unpack in it, especially in which Harrison Ford, at the prime of his career, pretty much plays the epitome of white ego and drags his family through quite a lot in pursuit of his own inflated pride. The thing is, he's pretty much perfect in the role and the brilliance is that you can't stand him, but you can't turn away from him either. Like his family, you want to keep following him deeper and deeper. River Phoenix is also a stand-out here and his narration provides a kind of calm amidst the insanity. Mirren is not given a whole lot to do, unfortunately, and I'd wished there had been a bit more drama between her and Ford, but she still inhabits the role with ease.",1,3,0,36,126,14/8/16,rated-8

This blew me away the first time, but now the entire post-refrigerator stretch - which I'd remembered as a short coda but is actually nearly half the movie - felt mostly unnecessary, transforming the film from a Herzog fever dream about a quixotic quest to conquer nature into a corny drama about a family held hostage by a Bad Dad. The first half is still fantastic, effectively (if bluntly) highlighting Ford's hypocrisy and delusion via the appearance of a Christian preacher out to ""civilize"" the jungle; I'd say this is a better exploration of these ideas than There Will Be Blood was, even if Ford's character is not as vividly drawn as Daniel Plainview. A strange, flawed movie that inevitably sticks with me for a few weeks, particularly the indelible image of a giant, monolithic icebox jutting out from the jungle. 73/100",2,2,0,51,123,8-Mar-20,rated-8

The first of them is Aguirre, The Wrath of God. Both films share common themes, of a madman who travels to the harsh lands of South Africa in a fruitless search.Aguirre was looking for the fabled city of gold, El Dorado, and here  Allie Fox (Harrison Ford) thinks he found his place on this earth. In Aguirre, Herzog's camera hovers around the cast, acting as an Unintruding observer.Herzog's film show's the journey Aguirre takes and how it brings out the insanity in the crew. Aguirre felt like a real character, driven with insanity and ambition to reach his goal. Allie does not feel like a real character. Ford's character blasts and scrutinizes America for it's capitalism. Yet in the entire film I failed to understand what the film truly means to say.Is it trying to show America's faults, yet also show the rest of the world is similar? That human beings will always find evil in any place?That the white man destroys every place he goes? Ford's character feels more like a shouting man who offers nothing to fix the problems. Which is a shame, since Ford does give it his whole, in one of his first roles away from his cocky Han Solo/Indiana Jones persona. The other film I was reminded of was Danny Boyle's The Beach.Two great directors who made films that I could see what the film tries to say, I felt both had a great film in them. And somehow both failed to bring out anything of worth from an interesting idea.Both try to show the failure in creating a utopia, a place where all troubles are gone and people work together to create a perfect place for them. The Mosquito Coast, which followed up Ford and Peter Weir's first collaboration Witness (which I have yet to see), is sadly more similar to The Beach than Aguirre.I believe there is an interesting film deep inside The Mosquito Coast.It's just doesn't surface.",7,4,1,639,"1,165",24-Aug-14,rated-4

I think about you when I go to the bathroom. - Martha Plimpton is in this movie for like 2 minutes but delivers the best line in the whole movie... So in this White Saviors Gone Wild flick, we have Harrison Ford and River Phoenix, who in fairness, if you're gonna be white saviored you could do Much Worse, and yeah, haha I mean in the beginning of this film I was sniggering, Harrison could save my savage ass anytime... but yeah, of course we realize his ego is the real savage, and you end up feeling boundless empathy for his family. This is told from the perspective of River, one of his 3 children, who grow to actually fantasize about killing him, but I was mostly fascinated with his wife, played by Helen Mirren, who's ""stand by your man"" was full Tammy Wynette level. But hey if Harrison Ford was your hubby you'd be that way too.  Yesterday morning I woke up with this sudden clarity. When you're in love, there is this suspension of disbelief - just like when you're watching a film: you know there are cameras and crew and none of it is real, but it feels so real, and you're laughing and crying even though it's all make believe. Because you allow yourself the suspension of disbelief even though you know better. And I do, I have the strength and the ability to believe in someone forever, I can love hard and deep, because I have the capacity to forgive, and the ability to cherish a whole person, warts and all. Just like our savior's wife in this film, who clearly sees her husband as very intelligent in some ways, but very misguided in others. Still, it gets to a point where you have to hold someone accountable for their choices. And yesterday I just stopped suspending my disbelief. I let myself stop believing in Maestro, once and for all, because, haha, a quote I think I've slapped down two or three times this year on my reviews but one I've said throughout life: we must be very careful about what we pretend to be, because we are what we pretend to be. I've tried to believe he couldn't really respect or take seriously such moronic and unethical and nauseating choices, and he must be just playing along so he can live out debased fantasies or something... but even if he is just pretending to respect behavior that I cannot fathom anyone with a brain or a conscience taking seriously, he is still what he pretends to be. In this film, you realize that the savior must realize he's failed at a certain point, that he's made the wrong choices, and yet he still keeps going upstream, away from reason, because his ego can't admit he was wrong. And we can only pity him for the pathetic, cowardly trainwreck he's become because of his choices.Dear Letterboxd, this is the very last post you will ever read the word Maestro in, unless I'm referring to Morricone.",4,22,2,599,"1,080",12-Jul-20,rated-10

Wrong is a failed attempt at modern surrealism from Quentin Dupieux who's work usually branches outside the walls of the absurd. The main character of Dolph Singer is a confused man afraid to move on in his life, as attributed to his going to work still after being fired three months ago, and with all of the things around him suddenly changing after his dog disappears he's forced to look for what brings him joy in life. It's a simple message wrapped up in a box with no visible opening. Characters have death dreams, memories are extracted from doggie doo-doo, and metaphors and anecdotes are spouted with nonsensical whimsy until the bizarre becomes annoying and forgettable. Where it all actually worked together in Dupieux's previous feature Rubber it doesn't work at all here.

As you reach out and turn off your alarm, you stretch as you would any other day. Getting up to relieve yourself, wash up, and brush your teeth is as standard and autopilot as it has been for decades. Something's off though? By now, Paul, your fluffy dog companion would have come to bid you a fair morning or at the very least ask for his breakfast. You frantically search for where dear Paul could have gone! You look outside, you ask your neighbor who certainly doesn't jog, you ask your French gardner spending his work time sketching expressionist renditions of tools, you even call that cute girl down at the strangely designed pizza joint. Nothing. Absolutely no leads, no clues, no answers. You want to search more, but you can't be late to your office job that you were fired from three months prior. Who knows what could happen if you didn't show up, to pretend typing and answering calls as the ceilings pour a constant downfall of rain!  Alas, the workday is over before lunch, and there's a man trying to paint my car with a regular brush...what's more, we'll, he has a telepathic message that Master Chang demands a personal meeting out in the woods. It's urgent, and even though you and I both know that you have a hectic schedule juggling not having to go to work, having nothing to do at all, and chitchatting with your gardner or pizza crush, Master Chang might know something about Paul.  Quentin Dupieux's Wrong, is a surreal trip into what seems like a discarded absurdist deadpan comical episode of the Twilight Zone. A slice of life glimpse into this strange thing we call life. We follow a very charming Ryan Gosling older brother looking Dolph Springer (Jack Plotnick), as he searches for his lost dog. Along the way we meet a wide array of unique characters, all with their own vibrant and varying personalities and voices. Most memorable of all being the aforementioned Master Chang (William Fichtner), played with an almost Tommy Wisseau lost in Bavaria manner. There's not much meaning to the plot, and it's literally a trip into the absurd, which I can see not being for everyone. But I found myself entering with no knowledge of the film, to have been very entertained and along for all the wrong turns in Mr. Adolf's life. There's no given meaning, no grand resolution, no explanation to the madness, you're just along for the ride, like a passenger on a bus. That's life, am I wrong?",2,6,2,276,942,24-Jun-19,rated-6

Leaving all the crazy stuff for someone who hasn't seen the movie yet to get surprised about. Because there's just a lot to get surprised about, even though this may not be your first Dupieux movie.  This is my third Dupieux movie, all watched within a year. Something that is quite unusual when it comes to me, jumping back and forth between genres and directors like crazy. Anyhow,  Wrong may not be the funniest I've seen from him, but by far the most well put together. Yet I sure recognize the style, and in this the Kafkaesk feel is brought forward to the maximum with great success, leaving me to feel right at home in this little universe of his early on.   As for the performances Jack Plotnick that plays Dolph is just wonderful as the nervous guy trying to find his dog. And we also have the ""old timer"" William Fichtner in a pretty big role.

What a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! Dolph (I laughed whenever anyone said his name, especially when the Pharmacist/Pet Detective referred to him as Adolf) is a quiet, mild-mannered, middle-aged guy who wakes up at 7:60am and starts his quirky adventure in the hunt for his missing dog, Paul. While the film had very interesting point-of-view shots, great cinematography and a subtle and lovely score, the absurd and humorous story will surely remain the most memorable feature of Wrong. It is very clear that Quentin Dupieux is an imaginative and creative person with a unique vision of the world, an individualistically absurd sense of humor and an idiosyncratic approach to film-making; but he manages to keep the film rather abstruse, but in a refreshing, and pleasing manner. As the film began I wasn't really sure what to make of it but as it progressed, Wrong managed to supply a few, good and hearty laughs. The eccentricity only added to the entertainment, I really enjoyed this movie at the age of 31 but I know I would have absolutely LOVED this movie if I had seen it as a younger version of myself.  It reminds me a lot of the stuff I used to obsess over in the early days of what we now refer to commonly as ""Indie"" films.

Wrong, then, is his best work to date, its fantastically silly and utterly weird story of canine kidnappers and indoor storms all employed in pursuit of a simple, sweet message. Not to mention the hilarity that abounds at every turn, not least of all from William Fichtner’s delightfully airy performance as the head of the bizarre corporation who separate the depressed Dolph from his beloved dog. Dupieux’s suburban surrealism has shades of Blue Velvet, albeit rarely so horror-oriented; he, for all his black humour, is an optimist at heart, a fact the final act touts with pride.",2,2,0,272,"1,793",23/10/13,rated-7

It feels odd to give this rating. I unequivocally loved Quentin Dupieux's Wrong Cops. The aesthetic and humour instantly appealed to me, so I don't think my difficulties in judging Wrong is anything to do with being uncomfortable with Dupieux's style and comedic leanings. Though I never flat out disliked Wrong, there were times, especially early on, where I felt like its general weirdness was forced, or at least not delivered with the same precision witnessed from Wrong Cops's incredible cast. But as the film ticked by, I started to accept that while I wasn't going to find this as funny as Dupieux's followup effort, it was still a fascinating watch. The entrance of William Fichtner's Master Chang and his book about telepathic communication with dogs (I want a copy) signals a brilliant turn for the film as it swings into a blackly funny nightmare world. Jack Plotnick's performance as Dolph — a man desperate to find his kidnapped dog — becomes more emotional and teary as the running time ticks by creating a wonderfully jarring quality with the film's absurd story. As Steve Little's detective characters shows us a grainy video representing the memories of a dog shit, I decided I really liked Wrong. Its oddly touching ending sealed the deal. I think Wrong is a film that requires the viewer to be in the right frame of mind. And by right frame of mind, I mean the wrong frame of mind. Regardless of its weaker moments, Dupieux's style is unique. It's impossible to miss his stamp. His hands-on approach to filmmaking is also very admirable.

Whether the beats from Lost Highway are intentional or not, there's an inescapable feeling hanging above Wrong that leaves you longing for a better film. Wrong is by no means a bad film, oh no; it's Dupieux being incredibly brave with a script chock full of inconsistencies and off-the-wall symbolism. There are scenes that ramble on and are out of place in the conventional narrative that the film sometimes reverts to, and although entertainingly strange, this wears a little thin as the film goes on. Working on the thinnest of plots, Dupieux draws out some cracking moments and some inspired creativity throughout. The sentient dog turd that has actual memories is nothing short of hilarious, while William Fichtner's Master Chang is an odd-ball delight. However, Dupieux never conjures any of the same magic he created with Rubber, and he sometimes comes off as odd for the sake of odd here. Some of the weirdness actually feels like filler as he bulks out his story to a stretched 94 minutes, and while it's welcome in small doses, this film grows (dog-)tired at around its third act. Jack Plotnick makes for a fine leading man, and Dupieux gives him room to breathe in this, rather than just another extended cameo like he had in Rubber. Likeable and convincing us further of the dark-forces-are-at-work/conspiracy/David-Lynchy vibe, Plotnick's Dolph is a great creation, and proof that he is an actor in dire need of more work. Steve Little is also great as the short-fused detective who knows less than Dolph himself, but as I previously mentioned, it's William Fichtner who owns the show as the camp shaman with an implacable accent. With Wrong Cops lined up next, I can only hope Dupieux gets himself out of the rabbit hole and back to self-referentially insane movies and away from perfectly-reasonably odd films that remind you of other, better ones.",5,18,0,815,"4,646",24-Feb-14,rated-6

Is this movie for you? Well pleasantly weird and quirky in a mild mannered sort of way. There are lots of weird movies like 'Enemy', Under the Skin', or 'Inland Empire' that like to give a film lovers brain a good work out but are really intense and put you on edge. Wrong on the hand is like a candy bar of weird movies. You consume all the weirdness, and then you move on with out feeling worrying if you understood it. I think the fairly straight forward ending helps with that.  Also there is some excellent camera work, editing, and a retro score going on in the film, but the story is so far out there that all that gets pushed to the side.  So if that seems interesting, then check it out.... if not... then you will likely just say WTF afterwards and say it was a waste of time. But I like head scratchers... so I enjoyed it. Possible Spoilers: Where to begin..... I guess I would just like to talk about couple odd things in the film to help my sanity. So after our main character Dolph figures out that he has lost his dog, he notices a pizza ad. He is not hungry but instead wants to talk to the nice lady over the phone on why the logo of a rabbit on a motorcycle is  an odd choice. They both agree that likely tries to get across the idea that they have speedy delivery... but Dolph further points out that the rabbit does not need a motorcycle and it is redundant. The nice lady enjoys the conversation so much that she instantly wants to sleep with him. We find out Dolph goes to an office for a few hours a day, but he was fired several months ago and sits at his desk pretending to work. Actually everyone in the office appears to be pretending to work.. but the oddest part is that the fire sprinklers are constantly going off so everyone looks like they are working in a rain storm on their laptops and all.  The business appears to be a travel agency, so maybe this a joke on selling people expensive vacations that may be ruined by rain??? Who knows. Dolph learns that his dog was kidnapped by a guy named Mister Chang who apparently can use telepathy, and writes books about it. Mr. Chang steals pets because he thinks his customers under appreciate their animals and separating them and bringing them back together strengthens their love. But of course two times during the film something goes WRONG with this crazy business and he proceeds to comically say... ooo very sorry this has never happened before. There is a hilarious scene where a detective uses dog poop and his able to process it to make a video recording on the poops memories only to learn information about the dog napping case that Dolph already knows. And then the detective's assistant start calling him Adolph... which is even more interesting because the Dolph has a striking mustache. The girl who wants to wants to sleep with Dolph from the pizza shop ends up hooking up with Dolph's gardener..  the causes here to want to leave her husband and then go back and forth between Dolph and the gardener thinking they are the same person despite noticing they are obviously different people. This includes a scene where she comes out of no where to move in with Dolph and he has no clue who she is, he just wants to practice telepathy. Meantime she beings moving in and begins constantly bugging Dolph with all kinds of crazy comments and questions while he is trying to focus. The final part I want to mention is a wild scene where she wants the gardener who apparently got her pregnant to take her to the beach to have the baby. Couple things to note, they slept together apparently a week ago at the max. At one point the gardener dies  a stroke. Also there is a bit of a communications gap because he appears to be latino. Anyway, the time starts going back and forth on the beach. Where the baby ends up being a young pre-teen boy who is asking about a broken bottle and then the gardener has a vision of stabbing the women... but then ends up being relived because instead he wakes up being buried alive. Crazy funny stuff, and I needed to chew on it even more by typing out my thoughts on it. And I almost forgot the whole thing opens up on a shot of a fire fighter taking a poop outside with the other fire fighters sitting on the fire truck in the back ground ignoring a burning car.

However, Dolph's pet escaped a car crash and went from being kidnapped to actually lost, so Chang hires a detective to track down the dog and Dolph tries to make sense of his life.  So even though I laid out quite a bit for you there, there's still a bunch more details, characters, and events that take place. It's a very idiosyncratic film with each scene presenting something both jarring, new, and often hilarious to you as it all rides this fine line between dryly absurd and subtly surreal world-building. It's fairly well shot and all the actors commit 100% and like I said, there are many laughs to be had, BUT it is incredibly dry and if you're not laughing at this one at all then you're probably wondering why you should care about this mildly existential indie drama.  So yeah, hard sell. I say try to go into thinking of it as Lost Highway meets The Stupids but watered down a bunch and maybe it'll work for you. I definitely preferred it to Rubber!",5,16,5,386,675,15-Jun-20,rated-7

I bought it for $5 with the hope that what all of my friends have been saying is true; Troy Duffy's The Boondock Saints is a great film. This is my third attempt at watching it. The first two times I just couldn't get with it. I felt that it thought too highly of itself and it turned me off. Well I'm here to say that after finally making through the whole movie that The Boondock Saints is just as arrogant and self absorbed as I thought it was the first time. And the second time.  Now I did ask myself the question as I was watching this of ""Why don't I like this?"" This is a movie that is very much of that 90's rad generation of action film making where everything was much more stylized in an attempt to seem more hip to a younger audience. But the thing is I've loved movies like that; Pulp Fiction, Snatch, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, The Matrix, What to Do in Denver When You're Dead, Killing Zoe. So why doesn't this one work? Well because there is ""cool"" and then there is ""trying too hard"". ""Cool"" is The Fonz, Clint Eastwood and Deadpool. ""Trying too hard"" is Vanilla Ice, weekend bikers and Tank Girl.  In fact, Tank Girl is the perfect comparison to this movie. Tank Girl was an overly stylized film which felt that its use of comic book panel transitions and a wisecracking female lead were a lot more effective than the audience did and their inability to balance style with substance affected the story and the audience's enjoyment of it. And I'm all for style over substance with movies like Banraku and The Fall, but this isn't that kind of movie. This wasn't a spectacle like a Zack Snyder movie, this is Troy Duffy's attempt at following in the footsteps of Tarantino and re-capturing the spark that Pulp Fiction had, like so many of those types of late 90's flick. But what it fails in is that it is so soaked in its own self centered story that it drowns.  I think the point in which this movie went from crap to full on diarrhea was in the scene where Willem Dafoe, who plays an FBI agent, is reenacting a murder at the crime scene and we see him walking through the steps of the event while it goes on in a flashback. And by the end the operatic music (which is used way too often) swells, bullets go flying, and Dafoe goes ballistic and drops to his knees, firing his gun in the air like he's having Platoon flashbacks. It's a scene which even Tarantino would have said is overdone.  And going back to Dafoe, his character is the epitome of a sloppily written character. He doesn't really have an arc until the movie feels like they need to shoehorn in one for him. He's mostly in the movie to do his strongest Dafoe performance of his career up until the end, when his character actually has some semblance of character development.  I think fellow Letterboxd reviewer Fabian summed this movie up nicely when he said "" On top of the lazy dialogue the movie has no sense of style and tries way too hard to be hip in such a blunt and uninspired way"". And that perfectly sums up The Boondock Saints. This movie is repetitive, lazy and utterly forgettable. This is a failed post-Tarantino and Matrix project in the same category as The Doom Generation, and I can honestly say that I'm glad these types of films aren't seen much anymore. One thing's for sure, I'm sure as hell not watching the sequel.",8,6,0,92,588,1-Apr-16,rated-3

A prepubescent boy’s (Troy Duffy’s) idea of what the essence of Quentin Tarantino movies are—namely the narrative told out of sequence, morally ambiguous characters entrenched deeply into a big city’s criminal underworld, casual racism, stylized violence (well....my man Troy D tries his best here but it’s mostly slo-mo shootouts with his shitty band’s music playing in the background). Willem Dafoe’s level of commitment here is like a man furiously performing CPR on a body who’s been dead for hours. Sad to watch! Exudes a big arrogant dickhead energy much like its creator and my personal pick for the worst movie ever made because of how nothing of real consequence happens despite how painfully, confidently vile it is; look no further than this scene where a lesbian who can’t take a joke (read: can’t stand being mercilessly bullied lol if you have time I highly recommend a hate-read of the script) gets baited into getting knocked out by our protagonists.

I also enjoy action movies, which is why I rented it in the first place.  So I'm not a hater of this type of film, just this one! I saw this blind, knew very little about it besides getting very good reviews online.  By the first scene I knew I was in trouble.  It has an arguably good cast, but squanders any and all of their talents.  It is sill, stupid, predictable.  Take one example, Willem Dafoe arrives at the Crime Scene.... and puts earbuds in and puts on Opera , wow GENIUS!  Another, he is finishing having sex (He's gay!! What a twist!) and his partner says something about cuddling and Dafoe's response is ""Don't be such a Fag!""  Brilliant!!!  It only gets worse from there, eventually you get to see Willem Dafoe in drag... he must be the orld's ugliest drag queen.   You just can't make this stuff up.

A first time non-Hollywood amateur writes and directs. A national tragedy causes major studios to pass on the film, and therefore its theatrical release is very limited. When the movie does receive success on home video, a fight breaks out over who owns the rights to the film, and the director is basically blacklisted by Hollywood. There's still a debate going on today if Troy Duffy is a hack or a genius. The movie is somewhat controversial. Some think it's ""insert your favorite politically correct crusade word."" Also, it's very quotable and memorable. It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm shocked how little it's talked about on this site. Troy Duffy has an unique style of filmmaking. His non-linear approach might make someone think a reel is missing on a 1st watch. Especially, with his fade to black editing incorporated into the film. But, once you realize what's going on, you should understand the presentation. Duffy also likes extended scenes of dialogue, mixed with cool walking tracking shots and gratuitous violence. Maybe, Troy and QT hung out in the same video stores? To me, the MacManus Brothers are quintessential badass motherfucker cool. Pimp tattoos. Smoking cigarettes like a boss. The way they say their prayers. Plus, they're handy with the steel and they shoot the bad guys, stone cold dead. I couldn't imagine anyone else besides Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery as the multilingual fraternal Irish twins from Boston on a mission from God to rid the world of Pure Evil.  As much as I adore the MacManus Bros, the movie wouldn't be the same without 3 other critical players. First, there's Willem Dafoe as FBI Agent Paul Smecker. Does Mr Dafoe every play a ""normal"" person? He's batshit crazy going all CSI trying to figure out the case. He also utters one of the most memorable lines of dialogue in a scene about cuddling. Not to mention, the way he plays dress up, the gentlemanly way he orders drinks from the bar, and I swear, he goes all Platoon for a quick second. Dafoe's wack in all the right ways. I'm sure his role offends the easily offended.  Second, there's Russian mafia errand boy / joke teller Rocco played by a fella named Rocco. He's a loose cannon. His jokes are offensive. He murders a pussycat in cold blood. He doesn't realize he's the butt of his own jokes. He's fuckin' insane. His hair is messy. Yet, he's close to being the heart and soul of the movie. I'm sure his character offends the easily offended.  Lastly, there's Billy Connolly's II Duce. Talk about a fella stealing scenes with just the expressions on his face. For such a limited role, he's unforgettable. He chews a cigar like he's Fred Williamson. He's a father figure in many ways, and I'm sure his parenting style offends the easily offended.  I can best describe The Boondock Saints as a hyper-violent-guns-blazin' opera. It's loaded with over 200 uses of my favorite word, fuck. Over 30 bad fuckers die by bullets and or a toilet seat. I believe the film is misunderstood by its critical critics. What QT is praised for; Troy Duffy is ridiculed. If I had to focus on a weakness, it would be the boringness of the real bad guys minus Ron Jeremy. The Boston cops are cool underrated supporting players, and some of their conversations are absolutely hilarious. I love this movie, and I hope to see more reviews for it.  VERITAS!AEQUITAS!",8,154,26,577,"10,954",12-Apr-17,rated-8
The Boondock Saints,1999,108,thriller,action,crime, ,32660,398 fans,3.25,798,1363,1108,2566,2572,6122,6250,7319,2166,2396," The Boondock Saints is without a doubt the most Irish film you can find, being crass, loud, and flaunting everything it wants without a care in the world. Most of the stereotypes I hint at make sense given the ego and bridge-burning director Troy Duffy was responsible for in the process of bringing this controversial film to life, as the documentary Overnight details illuminatingly. That's a story for another day, as what we have here is a film that has gained cult appeal for its plot of two Catholic brothers taking the lord's vengeance on the wicked in their own hands, naturally leading to a smorgasbord of violence, numerous set-pieces of these vigilante ambushes, and fighting to try to and get you notice it through all the odd little touches that it so feels the necessity to include. There's a lot to like, and it has earned its cult stamp for a reason, but that same lot can turn around to rub someone like me the wrong way, though for me only a bit. Right, probably should start with what I liked. Willem Dafoe is easily the best part of the film, and almost all of the scenes with him in it are the most compelling and intriguing parts. Dafoe plays Paul Smecker, brilliant FBI agent who throughout is trying to piece together how these violent acts of retribution occur, driven mad and going absolutely over-the-top in the best way possible trying to solve these cases. Some of the more odder touches the script throws wouldn't land as well if it wasn't for him (Dafoe fully devoted in disguising as a woman will never leave my head oh god), and it is nice to see the detective-work as he tries to piece the many pieces together to show a true talent at his craft. The set-pieces that Smecker is trying to piece together, while I have my issues in their presentation, all look impressive and seeing the agent inserted into the action at one point as he tries to get in the minds of these vigilantes is a neat visual way of doing so. However, this leads directly into some of my beef, and part of why I can't enjoy this much. The overall presentation is very sloppily handled, with frequent usage of fading-to-black that really feels overdone, especially when we constantly fade-to-black in the middle of the investigation Smecker envisions himself in (why the final ""firefight"" with him has about five fade-to-blacks between our three avengers and Smecker rather than just showing it all unbroken is beyond me). The film also likes to overload an action scene with music, making the soundtrack devoid of sound effects such as gunshots or breaking glass that really downplays the intensity of these scenes. One instance of this would be fine, but when another scene introduced a slow-motion walk into this mix, it made me realize that Duffy here is trying WAY too hard to create a style, rather than let it flow naturally. A lot have accused this of riding the coat-tails of the success of Tarantino's game-changer Pulp Fiction, and while I personally won't go as far to suggest that, it does seem to resemble what people's worst impressions of Tarantino's work are, and that is mindless violence and action with some decent dialogue to spice up these street-dwellers. It is fair to say that if you don't exactly need much from an action film, it's hard not to go wrong with The Boondock Saints. It's a dumb film that has plenty of holes in its scripts (a scene revealing the brothers can speak 5 languages proves to be irrelevant) and it's penchant for violence and vulgarity takes precedent over any good taste and decency in order to please the sicker side of America (the film can fuck off for a cat being gorily shot at on-screen in an accident). Media coverage within the film asks bystanders what their thoughts on the Saints themselves are, and much like the film itself the reactions are truly mixed, with some in support and some vehemently against it. As for me, I don't truly lean towards either side of the ""love-it-or-hate-it"" debate, and if you were to ask me what I thought of the film after what I have to say here, I'd prove my thoughts just as well by saying ""no comment"" and giving you the good ol' ""Irish goodbye"".",4,9,4,289,662,5-Aug-19,rated-6

The Boondock Saints had some incredible moments; like Willem Defoe reenacting an act of crime paralleling the actual events. But the overall piece was terribly executed.

Also I hated all of the 'fade to blacks' that were used in the totally wrong moments, oh yes and the soundtrack simply sucked and made the action worse, not better.

It's pulp fiction in its literal meaning, often vulgar and violent yet nevertheless captivating. While it's not particularly well written or even acted, the primary relationship between the two brothers drew me in, and to see these family dynamics explored in such a brutal context was fascinating. Some of the jokes land pretty well, a nice touch in a film that easily could've been all too dark. It never hits all that high, but it also never falls all too low.

This was what everyone wanted? That just goes to show you, well, you know, how far off some people can judge things. Granted, there are some good ideas at the heart of Troy Duffy's The Boondock Saints: exploration of vigilantism as radicalism, an interestingly non-linear structure, and characters that might have been worth watching. As it stands, though, the film's execution sorely lacks polish or even genuine grit, relying instead on indulgent violence that masquerades itself as creative, all without really saying anything. In fact, most of the killing sequences struck me as originating from Duffy saying to himself, That sounds cool... Willem Dafoe is the film's saving grace, and then only sporadically so. Perhaps I should say that he should have been the saving grace. There are moments where I appreciated what he had to offer, but then other times was so over-the-top that I just couldn't believe it. The editor was clearly trying to make sense of the shots and give the film a fresh intelligence, but this effort was far too insignificant to make any real difference. Duffy is simply too bad of a director. All in all, The Boondock Saints is profane and mostly unpleasant, but above all majorly disappointing. You would think that somewhere down the line, there could be a provocative moment, but no, not really, no. I kept getting the feeling that Duffy and I would not get along at all if we ever chatted over films together, and I'm frankly okay with that. There is not much admiration to be gained when the director's tendencies in this film exhibit occasional ambition matched only with shallow thinking, affronts to decency, and general incompetence.",4,7,0,166,499,8-May-14,rated-3

How did you two fucking fucks... Fuck! When I chose this film to add to my list of films from '99 that embodied the growing stagnation of the time, it was more due to the mediocrity of the film itself rather than its' content. However, I did not expect The Boondock Saints to age this poorly. As evidenced by the sample quote above, the writing is atrocious. The acting is not much better, with the exception of Willem Dafoe. The editing, though, takes the moldy cake of this dumpster fire (there's literally a dumpster fire in this movie). Troy Duffy, a.k.a. a can of expired diet Dr. Tarantino, attempts to do something edgy and innovative with his crime drama, but what turns up is nothing but fantasy, a boring one at that. If, like me, you've been wondering if this one was worth a re-visit and deserves its' cult status... it's not, and it doesn't.",2,30,0,"2,193","1,783",5-Apr-19,rated-2

Needless to say, the cult tag around this film made me worried.  I was worried that the cult derives solely from needless garbage like boobs, fights, explosions, swearing, more boobs, etc.  The film fits the bill for all of the above.  Really, there's not much to this film - there should be a lot of to it however. The opening of the film pertains to religion and how the two vigilantes (whom I forgot their names, that's how forgettable the characters are), and that's about it.  The director throws in a family prayer, and some Celtic crosses throughout and ends with the unnecessary repentance of William Dafoe.  Saints is really more interested in just showing a tale of two vigilantes that end up changing a FBI agent (Dafoe), essentially, into their accomplice...rather than making a commentary on organized crime. It advocates their crimes on criminals purely on the case that they are criminals.  There are some blatant allusions to the vigilant Irish immigrants as being angels/saints, and they may literally be angels (as they are fluent in every language and such).  The director may be making a comment that all people, even if they're angelic, can turn bad, but when there is no consequence for them, it's hard to believe that such a comment is uttered. The religious aspects of the film are purely asides, and an afterthought in retrospect.  It's just an attempt to show violence and profanity, and there's plenty of it.  The only thing it avoids, and not entirely, is misogyny. However, for all of its faults, at least the editing is innovative and fits the narrative of the story (though that's hard to believe).

Probably the closest a film has come to making me physically retch (well, at least since The Platform). Not because of any gore (although that does exist). The movie is just so headache-inducingly edited. Seriously, the poor editing actually hurt my head (and my stomach). More towards the beginning (it kind of cleans itself towards the end) but enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth. Plus, it really feels like a homemade movie with a high production budget. My friends and I made a movie a few years back that's pretty terrible because we basically just put everything we thought would look cool into it, and this film was far too similar to that to be funny. It felt like a couple of kids watched Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and were like, ""We can do that too!"" And they somehow got Willem Dafoe to act in it. I've always heard about Quentin Tarantino copycats, but I'd never actually seen a film that copied him until this, and suffice it to say, there's a reason Quentin is Quentin.

For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon! THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!-Paul Smecker What the fuck did I watch? The film has no plot, no story and barely manages to string together ""action scenes"" that are nothing more then creative execution sequences. Yet I enjoyed most of the film. Unlike big budget action films, this one has entertaining characters in it, they don't make a lick of sense, but they are entertaining as hell. Imagine the MacManus Brothers (Sean Patrick & Norman Reedus) in an action film with an actual plot. It would blow everyone's mind. The film has style, entertaining performances and funny dialogue. It's just everything else that doesn't make any sense. I do most definitely count Willem Dafoe's over the top performance as Paul Smecker as ENTERTAINING. When he dropped to his knees and yelled out ""THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!"" I almost pissed myself. I loved being introduced to the aftermath of the bloodbath with Smecker figuring out what happened, then being shown if he was right or not. It's just sad that almost everything else outside of that is complete shit. Action movies often have dumb plots, but this one has no plot. Bad guys literally just show up to get killed. I would love to see what Troy Duffy could pull off by directing someone else's script.

A first time non-Hollywood amateur writes and directs. A national tragedy causes major studios to pass on the film, and therefore its theatrical release is very limited. When the movie does receive success on home video, a fight breaks out over who owns the rights to the film, and the director is basically blacklisted by Hollywood. There's still a debate going on today if Troy Duffy is a hack or a genius. The movie is somewhat controversial. Some think it's ""insert your favorite politically correct crusade word."" Also, it's very quotable and memorable. It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm shocked how little it's talked about on this site. Troy Duffy has an unique style of filmmaking. His non-linear approach might make someone think a reel is missing on a 1st watch. Especially, with his fade to black editing incorporated into the film. But, once you realize what's going on, you should understand the presentation. Duffy also likes extended scenes of dialogue, mixed with cool walking tracking shots and gratuitous violence. Maybe, Troy and QT hung out in the same video stores? To me, the MacManus Brothers are quintessential badass motherfucker cool. Pimp tattoos. Smoking cigarettes like a boss. The way they say their prayers. Plus, they're handy with the steel and they shoot the bad guys, stone cold dead. I couldn't imagine anyone else besides Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery as the multilingual fraternal Irish twins from Boston on a mission from God to rid the world of Pure Evil.  As much as I adore the MacManus Bros, the movie wouldn't be the same without 3 other critical players. First, there's Willem Dafoe as FBI Agent Paul Smecker. Does Mr Dafoe every play a ""normal"" person? He's batshit crazy going all CSI trying to figure out the case. He also utters one of the most memorable lines of dialogue in a scene about cuddling. Not to mention, the way he plays dress up, the gentlemanly way he orders drinks from the bar, and I swear, he goes all Platoon for a quick second. Dafoe's wack in all the right ways. I'm sure his role offends the easily offended.  Second, there's Russian mafia errand boy / joke teller Rocco played by a fella named Rocco. He's a loose cannon. His jokes are offensive. He murders a pussycat in cold blood. He doesn't realize he's the butt of his own jokes. He's fuckin' insane. His hair is messy. Yet, he's close to being the heart and soul of the movie. I'm sure his character offends the easily offended.  Lastly, there's Billy Connolly's II Duce. Talk about a fella stealing scenes with just the expressions on his face. For such a limited role, he's unforgettable. He chews a cigar like he's Fred Williamson. He's a father figure in many ways, and I'm sure his parenting style offends the easily offended.  I can best describe The Boondock Saints as a hyper-violent-guns-blazin' opera. It's loaded with over 200 uses of my favorite word, fuck. Over 30 bad fuckers die by bullets and or a toilet seat. I believe the film is misunderstood by its critical critics. What QT is praised for; Troy Duffy is ridiculed. If I had to focus on a weakness, it would be the boringness of the real bad guys minus Ron Jeremy. The Boston cops are cool underrated supporting players, and some of their conversations are absolutely hilarious. I love this movie, and I hope to see more reviews for it.  VERITAS!AEQUITAS!",8,154,26,577,"10,954",12-Apr-17,rated-8

The problem is, the style isn't even good style. The film just looks and feels very poorly made. The action is over the top in a bad way, the script is amateur, the acting is all over the place and none of it comes together into something remotely coherent. It's just a bad movie all around. It seems to be a love/hate movie though because it appears most people either love it or hate it, there aren't too many people in between.

It can't seem to work out if it's a serious exploration of morality or a silly action comedy about hypermasculitniy. It doesn't help that it has some of the strangest editing I've seen. Feels like you're watching a deleted scenes reel with all the fade-to-blacks.  Most of the characters were aggressively one-note. It was one of those instances where things become funny by virtue of them being done over and over again. Some of the jokes have not aged well at all... and as a moralistic tale it's deeply problematic.  But Willem Dafoe totally steals the show with an amazing performance as a gay FBI agent with sharp investigative skills. He gives so much to the role in a film that probably doesn't deserve it, all the while saving the film in the process.

And I think my 15 year old self would kick my ass for giving this anything less than 5 stars. Nowadays, however, I don't feel the same about this movie.  Everything from the direction, the writing, and the acting is...questionable. Some things are flat out stupid. For some reason, the brothers have to have Irish accents. Just make them Irish dudes from Boston. Not actual Irish guys from Ireland. Their accents get annoying and sometimes hard to understand. It's ridiculous. Oh, and Ron Jeremy. Yeah. And everything else just seems like it's trying really hard to be a Tarantino movie. A crime movie about hit men, trying to have interesting characters with witty dialogue. But none of it is as good. They even have their own ""Marvin  scene"" like in Pulp Fiction. But it's a cat instead.  I'll give this 3 stars mostly because of the bittersweet nostalgia I felt while watching it. It isn't a very good movie.

To be fair, after a little bit of research, I feel as if the story behind The Boondock Saints is much more intriguing than the actual film. How director Troy Duffy got his film made, being a nobody, jumping right into the big business, is quite a thing, especially considering this was only one of two films he ever made (the second being the sequel to this). But that doesn't take away that The boondock Saints isn't a load of quotable fun and entertainment. It might not be a story with deep meaning and even its concept of killing in the name of the lord to cleanse the world of evil isn't really thought out that much. Instead it focuses on giving more of an atmosphere piece with loads of comedy and bloodshed. It's a film build on entertaining, with a thinly veiled plot holding it all together. The trio of Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, David Della Rocco spew lines of gold every time they get on screen, with pure vengeance in their eyes, but they just can not be beaten by the majesty that is Willem Dafoe. He is at peak, ludicrous form here, defying the odds by getting more and more insane with each scene (while still maintaining the status of the ""smart"" head detective). River-dancing, conducting imaginary orchestra's, he bounces of the wall in the most beautiful ways. But what is probably it's strongest aspect, albeit brought in a very careful manner towards the end of the film, is its theme. While being a fun guns and gore romp, it does pose the question wether all this freedom is indeed what the world needs. The gun ownership in America has always been a problem and circumstances around this film showed that even better (I'm of course referring to the Columbine High shooting that occurred not very long before the film's release). Even though the film seems to glorify this, it keeps placing its leading characters as antagonists. Men who aren't fully good but not fully evil either. There ways of ridding the world of evil are well-intentioned but not really in a morally justified manner. It walks a fine but dangerous line that offers up room for a lot of questions that, unfortunately, still haven't brought much change. But that will probably not happen soon either... For what it is, it's a very good, very fun little flick.",4,15,0,973,"2,503",6-Aug-17,rated-7

I'll let letterbox'd brilliantly explain coyotes: ""The 'Coyotes' as they are affectionately called tantalize customers and the media alike with their outrageous antics, making Coyote Ugly the watering hole for guys on the prowl.""

Will she escape the clutches of her controlling father? Will her karaoke addiction be cured. Find out in Coyote Ugly.  This movie is really funny and corny and I enjoyed it. The soundtrack is vintage 2000 and the archetypes are intense. This also features one of my favorite things which is a scene where chaos is disrupted by the power of art.

His film starred Piper Perabo and Adam Garcia in the familiar tale of a girl leaving her small town to try to make it in the big city. If you're thinking ""I've seen this storyline before, do I need to see Coyote Ugly"" the answer is no. The film is just as boring and formulaic as it seems despite girls dancing on top of bars while pouring pitchers of water on themselves--I suddenly realize why the film grossed so much.  Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) is tired of waiting tables at a diner in her small town in New Jersey and only writing her music part-time. She is ready to make the leap to nearby New York and begin the pursuit of her songwriting endeavors full-time. After finishing her last shift at the diner and getting a wonderful send off from her friends, Violet goes home to pack the car for the move. Her father, Bill (John Goodman) is reluctant to let his only daughter loose in The Big Apple, and it's clear that she has taken a parental role over her father since her mother's death years prior. He eventually is as supportive as he can be with her departure. After arriving at the run-down apartment which is all she can afford, Violet's best friend Gloria (Melanie Lynskey) hides money in Violet's freezer that she is reluctant to take. After several disappointments in trying to get the mixtapes of her songs to studios and agents, Violet finds herself disappointed and rejected. When she returns home to find her apartment ransacked and her belongings stolen Violet cries and questions whether or not she should return home. While out for a slice of pie to drown her sorrows, Violet overhears a conversation between several girls waving money around at a nearby table. Violet gathers that they are ""coyotes"" working at a nearby bar. Following the bread crumbs she has sniffed out, Violet seeks the bar out looking for a quick way to make a lot of money. Violet is initially stunned to find out that the bar she has happened upon is a city hotspot in which the girls comprise a team of sexy women who entice patrons to pay for the show they put on. The rest of the girls can sniff out Violet's small-town upbringing, but what they can't sniff out is the passion for her dreams that will push her to do whatever it takes to succeed. Oh, of course, there is a love interest that initially looks like it's not going to work out. Of course, she's from a small town and wants to move to a big city, of course, she's the parental figure in her single parent home, of course, her apartment gets broken into, of course she loses everything she's saved for months, of course her friend from back home left money in the freezer, of course she overheard that there would be a position open at the bar, of course she was too shy to dance on top of a bar, of course she had outdated technology making it near impossible to adequately get her art distributed, of course, she had a love interest that she was reluctant towards, of course, she had stage fright--except when she was with the coyotes, and of course she eventually made it. I'm not kidding when I say this is one of the most predictable movies I have ever seen in my life. It's also aged horribly and was difficult to watch, as most films that prominently feature technology, clothes, and music. Throughout the entire film, when I'm supposed to be buying into how hard this beautiful white woman's life is, I kept asking myself, ""how hard can your life really be, you have perfect hair--if all else fails, shampoo commercials. A film as predictable and lazy as this just has nowhere to land with me, and few redeeming qualities about it, with the exception of John Goodman, he's always good--certainly the bright spot of this pile of garbage.",3,7,0,255,479,23-Mar-17,rated-1

Once upon a time in 2002, there was an 11-year-old girl who went to a birthday party/sleepover. The entertainment of the night was a movie picked by the birthday-girl herself, a VHS of a film that we probably all were a bit too young to watch at that age. That film was Coyote Ugly. As we reached the end of the film, we were all in love with Kevin and passionately arguing about ""who's who"" from the principal female characters. For the rest of that night as well as for the next morning before everyone had to go home, we kept reversing the film to the dancing scenes so we could learn the steps. I think one of my friends even asked for a water can so we could recreate that water-dance moment. (Luckily, we weren't given permission for that.) Once I got home, I instantly started begging my mother to buy me this film. I had to wait until Christmas to actually get it, and for a while, it was the most watched film in our household. For an 11-year- old in love with music and dancing and cute boys, this movie was a dream come true. It had catchy songs, multiple dance numbers and a cute guy who was handsome and charming, but still a geek at heart.  Around the time I first saw this film, another major thing happened in my life... I GOT MY FIRST EMAIL ACCOUNT. And since I had developed into a major fangirl already by then, my first email address ended up being ""coyote_ugly91@...."" and my password was ""ihanakevin"", which translate into ""lovely kevin"".  Once Lizzie McGuire Movie and The Princess Diaries entered into my life, Coyote Ugly took its place in the back-burner. But ever since I first saw it, it has been one of those films that I go back to once in a while, either alone or with a group of friends, for purely nostalgic reasons. It is a representative of a time when my life was all about sleepovers, best friends and learning new dance choreographies from movies and music videos. It is a representative of a time when a lot of changes took place in my life - first crushes, new friends, new discoveries. It is also the very first film I watched after my father died. My friend, the one that had this as her birthday entertainment, came over to my house and we watched this movie. For an hour and forty minutes, I was able to at least partially numb down my sadness and sorrow, and ever since that moment, this movie has held an even more important status in my life. I was able to be that care-free kid for a little while and I will be forever grateful for that. It has been probably at least 8 years since I last saw this film, but I felt like now was the right moment for me to rewatch it again. A lot has happened in my life since the last time I watched it, namely the fact that I have gained a film school education. I have been taught to analyze films, to dissect them, to appreciate certain traits, to notice faults. I am very aware of the fact that this film has its issues. IT IS FAR FROM PERFECT. In fact, I think if I would have seen it now for the first time, I wouldn't have been a fan at all. But the thing is... every single time I even think about this film, I see that group of happy young girls in their pajamas, prancing around the living room, dancing and singing the lyrics wrong to songs in a language that was still quite strange to them. I also see myself crying in the corner of the couch, grieving the loss of the very first man I have ever loved and trusted. Because of those memories, I am able to put my formal education aside and appreciate the film for what it is. It is a part of my childhood, a part of my own personal history. It is a film that was significant for me during my childhood as well as during a moment that will most likely for the rest of my life remain as one of the most difficult things I have ever gone through. It brought light into my darkness during a time I desperately needed it.  And for that I will be forever grateful. Sincerely, Coyote_Ugly91",11,251,16,89,201,6-Dec-15,rated-10

Anyway, this very derivative plot has young and naive Violet Sanford (Piper Perabo) trying to make it in the cut-throat songwriting business.  Kevin O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who works the grill, comes across like a sleazeball, as do all the gatekeepers at the music publishing companies. Violet sings on her roof space as her neighbour doesn't like her, and welshes out of an open mic slot, and ... she should just go back to New Jersey, really, back to good old dad John Goodman, but she doesn't, she takes a job at the Coyote where she gets unwanted attention from chaps, and starts dating the aforementioned Kevin. The songs aren't great, so Violet is unlikely to be the next big thing in the music business, and I'm not convinced that LeeAnn Rimes would record one of her borderline bland songs, but this is fantasy-land, and really, moving like a lap dancer on the bar to Def Lep's ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" and pouring beer over punters is one way to the top.

But the other was frustrated by the at times sheer sexism of it... It's really not deep or anything, and requires that you shut off your brain at least in part. But if you want to go looking for a plot, there's a paper thin kind of ""always follow your dreams and fight for them and you will persevere"" kind of storyline. Quite frankly though, it's more about watching scantily clad girls pour water on themselves and dance on a bar than anything else.  But so as not to overdo it with that either, the troubled main character finds a solution for all her problems, in a hot and helpful love interest. Because as all women know a hot guy automatically solves every problem you've ever had... (but it was at least cool he didn't make a problem out of where she worked).  And another thing that's nice is that all of these women, actually seemed to be having a fun and good time working at the bar. And they were all so incredibly supportive of each other. But the problem is it then erases the positive parts, by throwing in some downright annoying plot points. I'm making this sound really bad, and in a lot of parts of it is. But the reason that I kept watching is that it has lots of music infused moments, and that basically all the music had me nostalgic. I've always had a weak spot for ""I Will Survive"" so I was admittedly too pleased when it opened with that and when it appeared again. And the performances aren't actually half bad at times, Piper Perabo's charming as the main character. Still, watching this once or twice will probably suffice in this life time. I can get why some people would enjoy this in a ""guilty pleasure"" kind of way, and while I can do that with some films, where I just accept they're absurd and that they're not going to inspire any deep philosophical thinking, that's perfectly fine.  Sometimes just fun is exactly what you need. But I hate when that fun is in part compromised through some of the film's undertones, I have the kind of mind that can't really ignore that, and so often before the end I'm downright stressed and angry.",9,4,17,"2,042",835,28-Jun-18,rated-5

First off the politics and satire of this film is really confusing. Violet set up as a woman who has ambitions as a songwriter and wants others to sing her songs. Throughout the film, she has integrity and persistence despite her stage fright. Then all of a sudden she gets a job as a bartender at Coyote Ugly which is a diet lite version of a strip club and the girls basically dance for a bunch of simp men. Now here's where the confusing part comes for me, what was the intention of Violet working at this trashy place? Is it to make a point about the degradation of women just so they can make a living?  This could very well be the case but there's no meta/satirical subtext, it almost it's like its endorsing Violet to work here. There's not really a moment of insightful writing not even in a trashy unique way, more in we don't care let's just have girls dance way. Michael Bay is a photographer at the bar (yes *THAT* Michael Bay), the king of oversexualizing women for his art. This raises the question, was this a jab of at the mindless use of women in these types of movies? Bay uses this photo for profit almost like its one of his movies. There's a chance I'm overthinking it but it's the closest I can come to a concrete way to justify the endless amount of dancing bar scenes in this movie. Even ignoring that we never get an insight into how Violet feels about it, like no reflection on anything, if she likes it, hates it etc. If that was just said like once I would get the narrative arc a bit better but it's left a bit muddled.  That's how I describe a lot of this movie, it's hard to really interpret what the intention was with its commentary, politics or satire. There are moments of greatness but it's not enough to create a satisfying complete thematic arc. Don't get me wrong I like trashy smart films like Showgirls which is an exploitation film done right but this doesn't quite get there. Despite how entertaining and charmingly cliche this film is, as a deeper text it feels so close to hitting a home run for me. Maybe another watch or some insight from the filmmakers would deepen my appreciation for this. As it is it's an enjoyably trashy fun time but not much more than that. Also, I usually keep this to myself but no woman has looked as good as Izabella Miko in Coyote Ugly and I dare you to prove me wrong because you can't.",3,5,0,742,564,19-Apr-20,rated-6

It got a little wobbly and there were a couple of plot points which I thought were poorly written, poorly acted, and all a bit weird. It redeemed some of these points in its ending, actually addressing a couple of the things that pissed me off quite directly. The main thing being that I hated when Lil pressured Violet to stay at work and miss her opportunity to sing her song in club even though they had previously agreed that she could leave. Then, when Kevin turned up at the bar because he was worried and confused, Lil fires Violet because somehow she broke the rules. He turned up to the bar as a direct result of Lil's choices, not Violet's. Capitalism, man. I did not feel Lil was redeemed by the end just because she apologised, because she doesn't seem to fully acknowledge what her mistake was. I also didn't believe that Violet's friend would abandon her wedding night when Violet's father had an accident. I don't know, it was a bit much. There is plenty of fun in Coyote Ugly though.

It’s a bit all over the place but I can’t say I didn’t like it. Tron is a step into what 1982 thought computing looked like, with that comes jargon. There’s a ton of jargon in the first 20 minutes or so, which means a lot of the dialogue in that time is either useless or difficult to understand. Where the film gets going though is when you’re in the computer and even today that stuff is really cool. Yeah it doesn’t look great, but it’s blocky colours and dull palette give it a look all it’s own, nothing else I’ve ever seen looks quite like Tron. At times the film feels like a technical demo, to prove that a film can be made with this new fangled cgi technology, a lot of the more action scenes seem to be placed just to show off and so can give these scenes a bit of a pointless air about them. Their enjoyable, but feel a little hollow. For me though it was great to see bright eyed and bushy tailed Jeff Bridges, and the characters helped me to see the film through.

While it hasn't dated well, Tron features some very interesting ideas explored in quite an interesting way. Jeff Bridges' character is upset because his bestselling game ideas were all stolen by someone who is now heading a big corporation. He, in turn, is now beholden to an AI called Master Control who is stealing data left, right and centre. In a scene where Jeff Bridges is trying to hack the network and discover proof of what happened to his files, he sends in a program called Clue that looks just like him. Clue goes through the system in a kind of tank before being attacked by flying machines. While Jeff Bridges is tapping on the desk and waiting for the program to respond, Clue is actually under attack and unable to respond while he fights for his life. It's quite an interesting idea. While Clue struggles to succeed, Jeff Bridges' friend has a program called Tron which is much more effective. Tron is a bit of a badass to be honest. Anyway, it just so happens that a machine is being developed to transfer physical objects into a digital form. It's rather contrived, but not moreso than a lot of other sci-fi concepts. Within the rules of the movie, it works remarkably well. What's done especially well (and I had no idea this wasn't an original concept for the reboot/sequel) is the idea that ""users"" are like gods. For programs, users are all powerful and omniscient beings. They wait patiently for the commands of the users and obey them without question. One program is shocked to be told by Jeff Bridges that users are actually fallible. The visuals in the computer world have actually stood up very well and the scene where Jeff Bridges first enters the computer world is simply brilliant. There's also a very enjoyable scene where Jeff Bridges is using a strange flying machine within the computer world. The problem with Tron is partially that it is a little poorly paced (though not unforgivably so), but mainly that it suffers from a rather unsatisfying ending. Master Control is the bad guy, so they need to stop it. They stop it and that makes everything better. The end. In spite of all the interesting ideas that the Tron movie throws about, in the end none of them really matter too much, though it's really interesting to hear the ideas being raised and the movie does a great job at building a mythology (and, unlike in Tron Legacy, it doesn't seem to need voiceover narration scenes in order to do it). Both Tron movies have some good little humourous bits and in some ways I can see that the new movie captures the feel of this old movie pretty well. However, this original movie explains its ideas rather more thoroughly and makes some genuine effort to develop them. Also the visuals, though dated, seem to be rather more creative in some ways. A weak ending and poor pacing are not at all good, but some might be willing to forgive these flaws. What's especially sad about Tron Legacy is that Tron was clearly so close to being an excellent movie and just a few changes could make it really good, yet with all the budget they had, Tron Legacy ends up being just a pale imitation. But I'd say that Tron only just falls short of being a good movie. My review is here:fatpie42.livejournal.com/114452.html",10,9,0,338,533,24-Jul-11,rated-5

In the late 70’s and early 80’s, I started seeing CGI appearing everywhere, in commercials, in TV Station ID’s, and in films.  I was completely enamored with the technology and thought that I might start a company to develop CGI software.  I had already, in my tech job, homebrewed a pre-pc microcomputer based graphics system to display TV Listings information on a cable channel.    .  My graphics technology looked like this .  In other words, I fit perfectly in the arcade Pac Man world of graphics technology of the day. While I thought this was cool, it wasn’t nearly as cool as what I would see in when I attended a Siggraph computer graphics conference in ‘81.  When I saw Information International Inc.’s ( known as Triple-I) ‘The Juggler’, I was just floored.   There were four nascent CGI companies back in those days ….  Triple I ,  MAGI synthavision,  Able and Associates,  and Digital Effects. I had seen all their reels at Siggraph.  I had also seen Disney’s 1979 The Black Hole, which first introduced CGI onto the Hollywood Stage.  When Disney bet yet again on CGI despite lackluster returns.  Knowing that the four powerhouses were all involved in this new project, I was positively giddy to see the outcome. My recollection of that viewing back in the day was that I wasn’t blown away, but I was rather amazed.  This re-watch confirms this feeling. Jeff Bridges is one charismatic bad boy, and Bruce Boxilighter is a believable good boy.  Cindy Morgan is, unfortunately, cast as a typical 80’s Disney supporting female lead.  Because this was the house of mouse, they couldn’t really capitalize on a love triangle.  The good guy had to have the good girl. David Warner is one of my all-time favourite cinematic villains.   He spews his evil with such ease that you simply succumb to his venomous charm.. I wrote something similar about his role in Time After Time.  Warner has a particular skill at being both charismatic and deadly dangerous simultaneously.. Something I think the real Jack the Ripper and modern day monsters. What probably most impressed me on this re-watch is the fact that the film was so prescient without knowing it.  The Master Control Program hoovering up all the other ancillary innocent programs is eerily predictive of what happened during the evolution of our own favourite MCP, Windows.  It also scratched the surface of hard sci-fi with the concept of the programs looking upon the users as deities ( they should have, more correctly, looked upon programmers as deities and users as slavers … the fact that I started out as a coder has nothing to do with this opinion. ) CGI was a novelty, in fact, most of the film used traditional animation and photographic techniques to make it look like it was produced by the nascent technology.  I did get a smile though, in how perfectly retro the recognizers, light cycles, tanks, and solar sailor’s appear, where back then they were supposed to look like nothing you’ve ever seen; the shiny low texture artificiality a beacon of things to come; both in the arcade and PC game engines, and in the industrial CGI front.  I had forgotten that Tron was a 70mm film ( although the CGI bits were scanned to VistaVision, which was popular for FX work in the day ).  While on this watch I did detect a bit of aliasing, it’s still amazing that they could produce CGI images that could stand up in a 70mm blowup.   While Tron was rather lightweight as a film, it was the troubadour of things to come. I had the opportunity to take a two day seminar at Digital Effects in New York.  ( I think the manager of our little informatics computer graphics was more interested in a shopping trip to NYC than learning about advanced graphics technology)   What surprised me was that they were offering the course itself.  There were about 25 people or so, and they didn’t really tech us anything.  It then became clear, by little hints from the staff, they were struggling financially.  How could this be?  It was right after they made Tron.  Well, alas Digital Effects, along with MAGI, Able and Associates, and Triple I are long gone now.  That seminar taught me a valuable lesson, though.  High end CGI for movies would be a path littered with bodies.  I decided to stick to my knitting, and have lived to tell the tale.",10,40,21,322,"7,071",20-Aug-15,rated-7

And.... I'm glad it has a huge fanbase, because Tron is one of the most groundbreaking visual films ever made. It's early use of CGI was revolutionary at the time that without it, the new technology wouldn't have improved to phenomenal use in films like Terminator 2, Jurassic Park, and Toy Story. And while Tron is not an amazing film per se, I definitely give Tron all the credit for the groundbreaking effects. What's not amazing about Tron are the characters and story, and man, are they second fiddle to the effects. Jeff Bridges plays a computer genius who's games are stolen by a greedy CEO who created a Master Control Program that plots to control the human race. Bridges tries to infiltrate the CEO's business to get credit for his creations, but is sucked into the virtual game and has to take down the system within his own creation. There's interesting religious parallels where all the good characters in the same worship the human beings playing them called the ""Users"", and all the actors in the human world are playing the game counterparts, and all the evil game characters persecute the good characters for believing in the Users, even though the evil leader acknowledges that  Users exist..... gosh this gets confusing at times. I guess Jeff Bridges gives a good performance, but his character is nothing special. He's just a snarky computer nerd who believes he's smarter than everyone else, and gets annoying at times, but then again, he's Jeff Bridges. Give him credit just for being there. The other characters are just random people in the show, no more, no less, and I could care less about Tron, Uri, or the prophet character. Which is a shame, because again, there's strong themes that can be further explored and the visuals, though dated now compared to 1982 (especially those laughable costumes), are still groundbreaking and revolutionary for the time. I honestly don't mind how dated some of the effects are, because it's still a unique looking movie that'll never be replicated (even the sequel had some modern updates compared to the original). So why do I still recommend Tron, even though technically I should dislike Tron because the character's aren't compelling and the plot meanders into confusion. Well, for one, for what we got, I still admire the themes, even if they're not executed well. Any film about technology trying to control everything makes for interesting social commentary. That, and of course, the groundbreaking visual work, as mentioned already. It's definitely a fun time to watch with your friends if you just want to have a great time admiring 80s computer technology, but don't expect a Disney masterpiece. Still a solid, amusing film that does provide decent entertainment. ""End of line.""  63/100  NEXT UP.......

We have a simple story, one that all can engage with. Often we have movies based on computers that spend more time being factual and real than entertaining us. Here computing becomes easy to understand and entertaining. A smart move by Disney to allow a director to take a chance like this and one wonders if such a chance would be given to filmmakers today. The cast all memorable, some incredibly quotable lines, this film oozes a sense of fun and charm unlike many that have tried to be this film.  Obviously the visuals, sound and score though take centre stage and rightly so. A vision is played out in Tron that has not only set a culture for the last 35 years but is so defined and specific it is still notable today. Light cycle games still today to download on your tablet devices, the legacy of this movie still saturates our media centred lifestyles today The only real negative I have is the end, which kind of just ends abruptly with some music that doesnt fit with the rest of the score. Kind of feels like they ran out of money and just ended the film which is such a shame. I believe the film had another 20 minutes of story telling left with Flynn at Encom. Ho Hum.

Its cast make the most out of what they've been given with a good performance from Jeff Bridges, The Dude himself, but ultimately, Tron fails to excite which is a shame considering its status as a cult classic.  Certainly not the safest bid for success that Disney could have made in the 1980s. If you go in accepting its graphics and it's actually a visual feast for your eyes that you'll find yourself enjoying, and it's not completely bad. Just I had kind of expected a bit more from this film which suffers from a fairly underwhelming start. It certainly takes a while to get going to say the least. The concept of being transported into a videogame is a very appealing one and the idea and potential is fascinating, with the film itself arguably being ahead of its time. I'm going to have to bump Tron: Legacy up my watchlist now because I can't wait to see what the concept does with modern day graphics.

In the late 70’s and early 80’s, I started seeing CGI appearing everywhere, in commercials, in TV Station ID’s, and in films.  I was completely enamored with the technology and thought that I might start a company to develop CGI software.  I had already, in my tech job, homebrewed a pre-pc microcomputer based graphics system to display TV Listings information on a cable channel.    .  My graphics technology looked like this .  In other words, I fit perfectly in the arcade Pac Man world of graphics technology of the day. While I thought this was cool, it wasn’t nearly as cool as what I would see in when I attended a Siggraph computer graphics conference in ‘81.  When I saw Information International Inc.’s ( known as Triple-I) ‘The Juggler’, I was just floored.   There were four nascent CGI companies back in those days ….  Triple I ,  MAGI synthavision,  Able and Associates,  and Digital Effects. I had seen all their reels at Siggraph.  I had also seen Disney’s 1979 The Black Hole, which first introduced CGI onto the Hollywood Stage.  When Disney bet yet again on CGI despite lackluster returns.  Knowing that the four powerhouses were all involved in this new project, I was positively giddy to see the outcome. My recollection of that viewing back in the day was that I wasn’t blown away, but I was rather amazed.  This re-watch confirms this feeling. Jeff Bridges is one charismatic bad boy, and Bruce Boxilighter is a believable good boy.  Cindy Morgan is, unfortunately, cast as a typical 80’s Disney supporting female lead.  Because this was the house of mouse, they couldn’t really capitalize on a love triangle.  The good guy had to have the good girl. David Warner is one of my all-time favourite cinematic villains.   He spews his evil with such ease that you simply succumb to his venomous charm.. I wrote something similar about his role in Time After Time.  Warner has a particular skill at being both charismatic and deadly dangerous simultaneously.. Something I think the real Jack the Ripper and modern day monsters. What probably most impressed me on this re-watch is the fact that the film was so prescient without knowing it.  The Master Control Program hoovering up all the other ancillary innocent programs is eerily predictive of what happened during the evolution of our own favourite MCP, Windows.  It also scratched the surface of hard sci-fi with the concept of the programs looking upon the users as deities ( they should have, more correctly, looked upon programmers as deities and users as slavers … the fact that I started out as a coder has nothing to do with this opinion. ) CGI was a novelty, in fact, most of the film used traditional animation and photographic techniques to make it look like it was produced by the nascent technology.  I did get a smile though, in how perfectly retro the recognizers, light cycles, tanks, and solar sailor’s appear, where back then they were supposed to look like nothing you’ve ever seen; the shiny low texture artificiality a beacon of things to come; both in the arcade and PC game engines, and in the industrial CGI front.  I had forgotten that Tron was a 70mm film ( although the CGI bits were scanned to VistaVision, which was popular for FX work in the day ).  While on this watch I did detect a bit of aliasing, it’s still amazing that they could produce CGI images that could stand up in a 70mm blowup.   While Tron was rather lightweight as a film, it was the troubadour of things to come. I had the opportunity to take a two day seminar at Digital Effects in New York.  ( I think the manager of our little informatics computer graphics was more interested in a shopping trip to NYC than learning about advanced graphics technology)   What surprised me was that they were offering the course itself.  There were about 25 people or so, and they didn’t really tech us anything.  It then became clear, by little hints from the staff, they were struggling financially.  How could this be?  It was right after they made Tron.  Well, alas Digital Effects, along with MAGI, Able and Associates, and Triple I are long gone now.  That seminar taught me a valuable lesson, though.  High end CGI for movies would be a path littered with bodies.  I decided to stick to my knitting, and have lived to tell the tale.",10,40,21,322,"7,071",20-Aug-15,rated-7

Plus its neat minimal use of primitive computer effects while mostly relying on practical stuff firmly places it in the golden age of special effects. And that's a good thing, since it also forced the art directors to come up with a visually unique way to represent the digital world whilst also being acheivable without expensive computer effects, and the result is something ghostly. That's really fitting for a world where technically no humans exist. And it's only 96 minutes! Oh, to live in a time where big budget studio movies could still be less than two hours.

In 1983, Videodrome declared that we'd soon be entering the era of the New Flesh, but a year earlier Tron offered an image of what the New Flesh might look like, and what kind of post-human world it might inhabit (very blue, apparently!). Indeed, Tron's anxiety of a tyrannical A.I. emerging from our technological progress is matched by its love for the ""good"" A.I. characters, and foresees a future in which human and computer live and fight side by side for shared values. Though the narrative continues to remind us that Jeff Bridges is a ""user"" and is therefore a god-like figure among the programs, the viewer stops differentiating him from the other heroes very quickly, and by the end he's even fallen in love with another ""program."" Certainly part of this is that Tron is very much escapist fantasy, but Lisberger shoots the ""real world"" sequences to look as artificial, in their way, as the rest of the movie; perhaps we're already less human than we might think?

It works, though: Lucas' DNA is pretty obviously ingrained in The LEGO Ninjago Movie, not as superficial homaging but in the sense that it substantively uses the same emotional and thematic backbone of a son redeeming his father. (They even use virtually the same color symbolism with green!) Easily the weakest animated LEGO effort thus far, but it deserves much more than the lukewarm reception it's received. This is still better than just about any other mainstream animated cinema nowadays – Disney Animation and Pixar haven't been this good since 2010. It's finely animated (even the use of non-LEGO environments, which I was disappointed by in the trailers, turns out to have a thematic reason behind it) and has an actual personality. It's thematically cohesive and has a well-drawn and affecting emotional core that makes most of its earnest moments land. It is the least ambitious and memorable of the LEGO films, but it's still solid work all around. P.S. As Lane Pryce would say: ""Ka-wazakazawaka!

There's still the great LEGO-mation, the breezy humor gives some funny moments throughout (there's hilarious spoofs of Good Morning, America, the Wilhelm Scream, and various ninja references the die-hards will get), but it's definitely a step-down from both The LEGO Movie and LEGO Batman. Maybe it's because I'm nowhere as familiar with the Ninjago property as I was with Batman, but with the exception of Lloyd and his villainous father, which did have some solid emotional sequences, I didn't give a crap about anyone else, except maybe Jackie Chan LEGO master. He was cool, but everyone else was just a cookie-cutter, fill-in-the blank character with no real personality except the random power they have. Not a great way to get newcomers invested in your property when you don't care at all for 85% of your characters. At least Big Hero 6's cast had characters of defining personalities alongside the abilities they got which made them more memorable. This is more in line of direct-to-video level quality. I still enjoy LEGO Ninjago on a visual level, there's still engaging humor, and I liked some of the emotional moments between the main protagonist and antagonist, like I said, but come on, this could have been a much better film if the writing was just as clever as the other LEGO films.  I still have a strong hope for the LEGO franchise as, after experiencing the Batman one, there's potential for great LEGO films with other properties, but maybe Ninjago wasn't the right one to follow suit, especially if it's apparently a knockoff of the Power Rangers.  58/100",8,9,0,268,"1,035",26-Sep-17,rated-6

Lego Ninjago attempts to make up for that with more mecha, more characters, more daddy-angst...but results in less character, less heart and less interest. My seven year old and I both agreed that it was fairly dull, and that's a pretty good indication that it's failed as both a kids movie and as subversive escapism for adults - of which it aims to be both.  While Lord and Miller made their protagonists' blandness his secret strength in The Lego Movie, Ninjago can't escape the fact that Lloyd (or Lu-Loyd) is boring and his friends are just action figures the directors smash together. It doesn't help anything that the Ninja's start off with cool mecha to battle Lloyd's evil father Garmadon with, rather than earning them for a final showdown.

I wasn't even there” In spite my small issues with it, the first LEGO-film had a nice reality-twist but in this… Spin(jutsu)-off they reveal that immediately, throwing in a live-action Jackie Chan to make it look like a commercial from Cartoon Network. If that didn’t tell you how much of a weaker film this is then… Everything following that should cement that fact. Maybe it’s unfair to directly compare The Lego Ninjago Movie to the first Lego-film but this is a dumber, worse version of that in every way. Like, didn’t we just have a film about a villain being the father of our main character? The animation here is still strong, full of details and the film has a nice action-pace but there’s nothing in between, with incredibly thin character-focus. Focusing on an unnecessary plot, the film often loses momentum and ultimately the small glimpses of creative comedy and animation can’t make up for the big lack of heart. 2017",3,8,0,347,896,16-Apr-19,rated-4

The Lego Ninjago Movie derailed that direction quite a bit. I'm not gonna lie, this movie dragged like hell. There were multiple times I was tempted to turn it off. I was actually looking forward to see it. And now that I have I'm very disappointed.  Was ""Ninjago"" the best choice among all the franchises Lego owns to make a movie about? I would have liked to see a Lego Star Wars movie or a Lego Marvel movie instead. The thing that made the first two Lego Movies funny were it's references to other well known movies and movie characters. And of course the writing in general was great for those two. This one doesn't have any of that. The characters were really flat and boring. And the jokes weren't good at all. I paused the movie so many times to do something else (like writing this review). There wasn't a moment of tension in it to keep me glued to the screen. Some positive things among all the bad stuff was the animation, which was really good and photorealistic. The voice actors were all fine too. But Justin Theroux as Garmadon was the best thing in the movie. He was practically the main character at some point. Which was far more interesting to follow then Lloyd's story. And there were a couple of moments were I laughed. But not enough to keep me entertained. I think that Warner has got some thinking to do about what their next Lego Movie will be about. Don't take some random franchise. I know it's popular among the kids (and some older kids too I guess). But you gotta focus on the older generation as well. Which worked for the first two. I know I keep referring to those a lot in this review. But they are the better movies.

I was on a connecting flight from Chicago to Seattle and this was the in-flight movie, which threw me off and made me think that the trip would only be two or three hours rather than four or five, much to my economy-class-seating dismay. Being much more concerned with reading through my author-annotated copy of Star Wars: Heir to the Empire, I only occasionally glanced up at the tiny screen playing this movie, and never bothered to put in my headphones to listen along. But what I did watch was a chaotic frenzy of animated action, and that really interested me. I'm sure the movie isn't all too great when you add in the storyline and characters and such, but purely from the level of watching it on mute, the movie's action scenes are incredibly dynamic and eye-catching. These Ninjago guys seem to have different robot mechs that they use when they fight in the middle of Neo-Beijingokyo or whatever, and combined with the stop-motion-esque Lego animation, the battles actually look like a model city is being ripped apart by massive explosions and missile-launching dragons. It's just really cool. This is the kind of stuff that advances in animation have allowed, but haven't been able to explore because of genre limitations, namely that animated movies are 90% kids films. How many animated movies this decade have actually been able to have highly-choreographed action sequences? The Lego movies, Big Hero 6, How to Train Your Dragon... Wreck-it Ralph maybe counts? That's about it. Think of how animation could completely change action movies if they were given the chance; people bemoan the weird plastic-y CGI-enhanced action sequences in movies like Avengers 2 or Justice League, but if they were fully-animated that would be a different story altogether. Something's got to come along soon and show Hollywood what can really be done with animation. Maybe the new Spider-Man will do the trick?

Sure, it doesn't do those things as well as the first film, but despite of what the predominant discourse on this curiously low-profile blockbuster has been saying, it definitely feels like a step up from February's 'Batman', which were annoyingly dependent of references for its comedic bits and had far messier action set pieces. In many ways, it is also the giddily joyful 'Power Rangers' adaptation some were apparently waiting this year's adaptation to be, and while the mocking of an egotistic megalomaniac that wants to destroy the world is always welcomed in these dark times, it's hard to take much pleasure from it considering both said character's arc and Mnuchin's credited role as an executive producer in both of the previous installments.

The Lego Ninjago Movie isn't deep or interesting or nearly as good as The Lego Movie or The Lego Batman Movie but being a Lego movie means it for some reason gets to keep making irreverent jokes that suits my own weird perfectly everytime. Lego Humor (as I like to trademark it) is a unique type of humor only lego can do and I hope they keep making all kinds of lego movies forever. I have criticisms but frankly, I don't want to bother.

Not without its charms, if only because the comic mileage these movies get out of juxtaposing those bits of plastic with “real-world” elements seems limitless. Justin Theroux is a virtuoso at comically arrogant bluster as Garmadon, and the fight in the bamboo clearing between him and Jackie Chan’s Master Wu blends physical action and physical comedy so thoroughly you’re left grinning like an idiot. Other than that, there’s really not much here. The filmmakers noticed the frantic pacing of THE LEGO MOVIE but not its density, how that movie overflowed with tongue-in-cheek cracks at seemingly everything under the sun.

It is a great entertaining animated movie. Laugh out loud funny and worth our time. So what's the problem?  People keep comparing it to both The Lego Movie and The Lego Batman movie. These two movies are completely different entities to this film. Why? The Lego movie was the first of its kind and to hook us all in grandstanded the broadest selection of pop culture characters it could. We were so entertained by seeing hugely popular figures from our childhood and separate franchises showing up together for a fun adventure. The Lego Movie was a success partly due to our own sense of Nostalgia. Also the Lego Batman movie was made for Batman fans. The humour was so driven towards the DC and Batman culture that has been on our screens since 1966. Again, the films success was partly due to the already hugely popular Batman who then becomes all too easy to lampoon. Here with Ninjago this is the first time the franchise has had to stand on its own two feet without the massive pop culture buy in it has had previously. It has to build it's own culture which as we all know takes time. If you forget the impact of both the Lego predecessors and watch this as an individual story you will see a witty, emotional, visual treat with some incredibly funny moments, especially in interchange between father and son and the news readers who feature throughout. It has a moral but centres on the comedy. An excellent voice cast who all do amazingly but a stand out mention has to be made for Justin Theroux whose villain father figure is one of the funniest creations on screen this year. If this had come before both the Lego movie and the Lego Batman movie I believe that more people would be raving about this. Sadly peoples desire for pop culture references and peoples sense of nostalgia that has previously been met by the Lego movies has blinded people to see just how funny and entertaining this film is.

On the other hand — and this is a scientific fact — not a single person who’s gone through puberty has ever heard of “Ninjago.” Ninjas? Sure. The concept of going? Absolutely. But “Ninjago”? That’s definitely not a real thing, let alone a popular line of toys that’s spawned graphic novels, video games, and a television show that’s now been on the air for six full seasons.

THE LEGO MOVIE perfectly adapted concepts of why we love Legos in the first place; touching on themes of creation, individuality and togetherness. LEGO BATMAN is a riff on the entire cinematic history of the Caped Crusader while embracing everything that makes the character work as a whole. So what does NINJAGO bring to the table? At first, not much. The opening act of the film is a haphazard hodgepodge of traditional animated movie fair. Bright colors. Someone who just doesn’t fit in. Loud music. Countless bits of information are thrown at you too early too fast. It’s a cinematic sugar rush that turns sour fast. Part coming-of-age story, part superhero team up, part martial arts homage, all leading up to… something. From the outset, it’s unclear where the movie is headed. One can’t help but think the crew were unsure of themselves either. Adding a live action bookend to open and close the film doesn’t help much and actually detracts from the experience. But the world of NINJAGO is gorgeous to behold. The visual splendor of CGI legos grafting together tapestries of imagination are something only a child could cook up. An ongoing theme of endless wonder will continue to be the heart of this universe wherever they may go. Ninjago (the city) is a feast for your eyes. Gigantic buildings and towering lego robots wander the streets and rise out of the water between day or night. We might as well call it baby’s first BLADE RUNNER. Much like BLADE RUNNER, NINJAGO implements a variety of cultures from Eastern Asia. As a person of color, it is disappointment as so few of the cast members are of the same background. That’s not to say anyone isn’t good in the movie (I promise, we’re getting to why I actually liked this movie soon) it just feels like yet another missed opportunity in an ongoing series of them in Hollywood. Although, Kumhail Nanjiani and Jackie Chan are inspired casting choices for their respective roles in the film. As the story progresses, the sugar coating keeps getting tossed on and on. Tonal inconsistencies spring up like daisies but you can practically feel the movie find its footing after tossing its primary hero, Lloyd (Dave Franco doing pretty remarkable work here), into the chaos of uncertainty. After establishing conflict, a new status quo and a breadth of ideas to explore over the course of an ongoing adventure, the lego ninjas find themselves on a quest to save their homes. Along the way, the group of ninjas outside of Lloyd aren’t given much to do outside of some fun gimmicks and for that short while you can feel the movie not giving in to its broader superhero team up ideas. It’s about Lloyd and his purpose as a team member, a friend, a son and a growing kid. Everything pertaining to the actual narrative drive and crux of the story is, needless to say, about character and his relationship to his arch-nemesis/father, Lord Garmadon. However, even after the movie finds its footing, you’ll still find yourself rolling your eyes at the incessant need for jokes to lighten the mood. And sometimes, the constant bickering and comedic beats even attribute to the scene. To make something clear, when Ninjago works, it’s a wonderful time for the whole family. When it doesn’t, there’s still enough on display for the kiddies to enjoy while you take a breather from the barrage of… well, everything. It’s hard to talk about why the ending works as well as it does but for those of you who have parents who were separated, prepare for some heartstrings to be pulled. NINJAGO isn’t so much any single stab at a genre as much as it is using those genre tools to explore a story of enlightenment. Taking cues from KUNG FU PANDA and, of course, the first cinematic Lego outing, NINJAGO is wholly better than the sum of its parts. Don’t get me wrong, the execution is far from perfect. The wrap up is too tidy and the bookends significantly harm the final film. Look, if this is to be the least successful of the Lego franchise thus far, things could be a whole lot worse. Sometimes, these stories are just good enough.",9,7,0,207,969,19-Sep-17,rated-7

It's a little underwhelming overall but it still has enough to like for me to give it a pass. It starts off quite poorly with humour aimed mostly at kids. However it does get better about a third of the way threw and becomes an enjoyable enough time. The voice cast all nail it, the animation looks great, and there are some genuine moments of both hilarity and heart. It lacks so much of the clever humour of the other instalments as well as a lot of their heart, but theres still enough here that made me enjoy it overall.

Like, he's underaged now, but the moment he turns 18, he'll be working at the gentleman's club. Ok, the guy has a chip on his shoulder bout his pops. What's the deal? The problem is that the film will never let you stop reminding you about it. The same with a lot of the jokes they tell. They make sure to do roundabouts two to three times per conversation to REALLY get you to understand that it was funny. Add in them having to basically spell out everything for you turns this wonderfully animated children's film into a regressive pile of angsty trash. There's being subversive and then there's being ""meta"". Subversion tackles widely held beliefs and sensibilities in a meaningful way, often twisting and manipulating them to surprise audience expectations. If done poorly, meta is the poor man's subversion, often having to rely on cheap jokes and tricks to appeal to a niche audience, adding nothing to the equation and simply reiterates what has been done. The LEGO Ninjago Movie is literally just a grown-ass man's meta-comedy about daddy issues and wuxia tropes, fittingly becoming the dad jokes of meme movies. We're cringing at you, not with you, guys. I'm definitely not the target audience for this one.",4,7,2,124,136,11-May-18,rated-2

I laughed, I had a smile on my face the entire time, I even teared up at points (flaming tears of course), in a movie about goddamn lego ninjas. My parents should be glad this didn't come out when I was a kid, I'd probably want every goddamn set. I mean sure there are flaws I guess... the Ninjas besides Lloyd don't get much development, and I guess it's not that original and... you know what fuck ""objectivity"" (by far the least interesting way to analyze any kind of art anyway), I would say this is the happiest I've felt watching a movie since Valerian, but I'm pretty sure I felt happier watching this. Like this is the best power rangers movie of 2017, but it also has a lego Jackie Chan (and a real one oddly), and vague life lessons who-hoo! Also there's a cute cat named Meowthra who wrecks the lego city (just like my own furbaby <3) and for some reason nothing warms my heart quite like Lego families. I could watch misguided LEGO dads reconnect with their sons for another hundred movies. That was more incoherent than I wanted it to be. Once in a while there's a movie that just speaks to my inner child on such a personal level and this just happens to be one surprisingly. This seems to be the most underseen of all the lego films thus far but if you liked the other lego movies (and why the hell wouldn't you?) and/or have any reason to think you'd like this, then I definitely recommend giving it a shot!

This movie is like the visual equivalent of that experience. I will never forget going back on this movie tonight. It was so much worse than I could have ever imagined it to be and I think it might be one of my all-time favorite so-bad-it's-good films. This movie is straight up bad for your brain. The story is fucking stupid, all of the characters are obnoxious and the special effects are some of the worst I've ever seen in a Hollywood film. Like, this movie came out in THEATERS in the same year as Peter Jackson's King Kong. Say what you will about how that film's effects have aged, but holy shit, this is just fucking unacceptable and I loved every second of it. This is one of those films that has to be seen to be believed. If you remember this movie being anything more than an embarrassing and hilarious dumpster fire, I implore you. Please. Go back and watch this fucking movie. I promise you will not regret it. Just get ready to feel like you're getting dumber as you're watching it.

I have very fond memories of watching so I went in to this movie scared if I would still like it as much as I did as a kid. While it’s honestly not that good in many aspects I still thought it was very entertaining and fun. The plot is cliche and campy but entertaining. Dreamland is a cool setting that every kid will love. The acting is ok Sharkboy and Lavagirl are memorable characters. George Lopez as a CGI electric robot is super creepy. The CGI is absolutely horrid and some of the worst ever. 2005 had some movies with great visual effects like King Kong so why does this movie have such horrible CGI?

The best word to describe The Taste of Tea would be calm. Staying true to the slice of life genre, there is no real plot, no dramatic climax or suspense build-up. Instead, you have several quirky little characters with their own storylines which is layered out at a comforting pace (often intertwining with eachother) and every single one is just slightly unique enough to keep you engaged. Couple that with some surrealistic editing techniques and some rather absurd plot elements, and you have a surprisingly enjoyable feature film on your hands.  A word or two should also be given to the camerawork, which captures the vast beauty of Japan's mountains and forests in a nearly meditative manner.  The Taste of Tea took me by surprise, but as far as im concerned, this is a perfect film to watch during lazy, summer nights.",4,5,0,102,314,3-Jul-14,rated-7

So yup, you guessed it right - ""The Taste of Tea"" is another heart-warming Japanese family drama encircling around everyday lives for each of the family members with nothing more going on.  It's weird that one of my teachers here at film school once told me that you have to find a dramatic problem for your film. Well, correct me if I'm wrong; but there really isn't a dramatic problem in ""The Taste of Tea"". There are some minor ones along the way I admit that, but not a big one you'd find in other films that would significantly help carry the story forward.

Had I gone in knowing more of what I was getting myself into I think I would have had an overall better experience but I eventually found my groove with the film and it became an incredibly lovely experience. The images here are incredible and the whole thing is oh so gentle. I love the use of surrealism in a much slower movie as it lent to a bizarre atmosphere that I couldn't quite place. The experience of watching this is exactly akin to the experience of having a dream in which everything is only slightly off. Even it's sense of humor was very gentle. So many images that would be goofy in any other film are mostly just charming here or lend directly to the story. Those magical touches are what make this worth watching! That and the amazing yet very real relationship between family members. I especially loved the son's storyline a lot. There was something about that sort of young love that felt incredibly genuine. The grandfather SPOILER dying was also very emotionally affecting which was kinda surprising given just how odd the whole thing was. Not a film I'd recommend to just anyone, but one that I really admired. I don't think I've ever seen a better combination of dream-like and naturalism ever before in a film. Also the ending was one of the best sequences I've ever seen a movie. That whole last 10 minutes with the sunflower in space. Took my breath away.

The Taste of Tea follows the many micro-adventures of the Haruno family, as they each set out to achieve their goals. It's pretty much unevenly divided between the 6 family members who all generally have an idea of what they want, but run into more than a few colorful characters and obstacles along the way. For me, it felt like a series of short skits combined into a fairly cohesive narrative. Some of the tangents served a purpose, while others just happen for comedic value. Even with the entire family going through their arcs, the movie still includes segments of random characters doing unusual things, that often lead to some sort of pay off with the main story arcs. The biggest draw is the clickbait type image of the giant version of the girl following herself around. We're curious to see how that plays out and Sachiko's arc is the most straight forward as she's the youngest who's only got one objective. The eventual pay-off is totally worth it. In terms of being a family, there's not too many scenes of them all interacting together, but the few we do get are more than enough to cement their close ties to each other. For me this film is hit and miss; I enjoyed some of the character arcs and strange bits more than others. It's very creative with loads of great ideas that Katsuhito was able to mix in and make work. I'd say it's worth seeing out of curiosity alone, but not to expect too much. >Watch once.",7,5,0,172,172,14-May-20,rated-7

And a lively granddad with an enormous sense of fun who occupies an apartment adjoining that of the main family home – a place that only he is allowed to enter. And then there are the peripheral characters, which means there’s a lot to digest. For instance, there’s an ace baseball hitter who happens to be a yakuza, a couple of manga robot cosplayers and a creeper boss who makes the mistake of underestimating a seemingly timid female employee (and then goes on to record a stupid song about mountains, that is actually quite catchy). With all of this going on, it sometimes seems that there’s little point to the screenplay – that we’re just being presented with a hodgepodge of quirky vignettes but it becomes evident that each of the core characters is trying to achieve a goal, whether it be moving beyond a heartache, making a breakthrough at work, mastering a backflip or meeting ‘the one’. And of course, the passage of time means that the characters get a little older, which is fine if you’re, say, a little girl or her young uncle (played by the ridiculously handsome Tadanobu Asano) but if you’re in the twilight of your life…  The Taste of Tea pays off in a most delightful, rewarding way. I love how it focuses on little details, the sort of things that matter to the individuals concerned – and handles bereavement with a lightness of touch while showing utmost respect (which is quite common in Japanese cinema).",4,7,0,366,397,21-Jun-20,rated-8

Not every main character in The Taste of Tea has a storyline that follows the pattern of conventional narrative arc, nor offer a resolved closure. Besides, the film’s focus would occasionally shift to side characters who have no major connection with the main cast, nor having any significance onto the overall plot (if there’s one). It’s the weightlessness and the casualness which distinguish this family tale from the traditional Japanese family drama by, say, Yasujiro Ozu or Hirokazu Koreeda. This film is closer to magical realism than realistic drama, visually supported by the imaginative use of animation and CGI. I would prefer the storytelling a bit tighter though.

Ich kann es ehrlich gesagt nicht so genau beantworten. Das einzige was ich nach 293 Minuten heftigsten Mindfuck, mehr oder weniger, mit Gewissheit sagen kann, ist, dass ich zwei wunderschöne Filme gesehen habe. Damit ich nicht völlig dumm sterben muss, habe ich versucht bei Wikipedia nach den wichtigsten Antworten zu suchen. 1.Sperma (altgr. σπέρμα, spérma: Abkömmling, Abstammung, Geschlecht, Stamm, Nachkomme(nschaft), Sohn, Spross, Grundstoff, Keim, Saat, Saatgut, Same, Samen) ist die Befruchtungsflüssigkeit männlicher (in Hypothesen der Antike und des Mittelalters auch als Zeugungsbeitrag weiblicher) Tiere und Menschen. Das Sperma von Menschen und Säugetieren besteht großenteils aus der in der Bläschendrüse und anderen akzessorischen Geschlechtsdrüsen gebildeten Sekretflüssigkeit. Darin sind die in den Hoden gebildeten Spermien enthalten, die durch die Samenleiter in die Prostata gelangt sind. Es enthält auch Epithelzellen der Hodenkanälchen. Die Trägerflüssigkeit wird als Seminalplasma oder Samenplasma bezeichnet.Sperma wird beim männlichen Orgasmus etwa ab Mitte der Pubertät, nachdem die Hoden mit der Spermienproduktion begonnen haben (Spermarche), durch den Penis ausgestoßen (Ejakularche). Beim Vaginalverkehr kann es durch den Kontakt von Sperma mit einer Eizelle zur Befruchtung kommen.  2.In zahlreichen Mythen und Bräuchen taucht das Ei auf, das statt eines Hühnereis das Ei eines anderen Vogels oder Tieres sein kann und oft von keinem Tier stammt, sondern von einem ersten Gott geschaffen wurde. Das Ei verkörpert dabei in vielen Schöpfungsmythen den Ursprung des Lebens, oft als Weltenei, aus dem die Welt in Gestalt eines Allgottes hervorgegangen ist. Nach der finnischen Mythologie, der Kalevala, ist das Universum aus sieben Eiern entstanden, sechs goldenen und einem aus Eisen. Demnach wurde aus den Schalenhälften der Himmel und die Erde, aus dem Eigelb die Sonne, aus dem Eiweiß der Mond und die restlichen Schalenstücke bildeten Sterne und Wolken. Aus dem schwarzen Dotter des Eies aus Eisen wurde eine Gewitterwolke. Auch im Christentum spielt das Ei eine Rolle. Der christliche Brauch, Ostereier zu schenken, geschieht im Glauben an die Auferstehung Christi. Der syrische Kirchenlehrer Ephraem der Syrer schrieb dazu im 4. Jahrhundert: „Gleich einem Ei springt das Grab auf.“ In Deutschland wird der alte Brauch der Eierverzierung zu Ostern besonders bei den Sorben gepflegt. In der Gegend um Bautzen werden kunstvoll Ostereier in sorbischer Tradition gestaltet. Eiern, die an Gründonnerstag oder Karfreitag gelegt worden waren, schrieb man im Mittelalter besondere Kräfte zu. Man ließ sie zunächst weihen und deponierte diese Karfreitagseier dann im Haus, um dieses vor Überschwemmungen oder Feuer zu schützen. Missgebildete Hühnereier wurden im 19. Jahrhundert auch als Hexeneier oder Hahneneier bezeichnet. Das Eierorakel ist seit der Antike eine Methode der Wahrsagung, die im europäischen Aberglauben überliefert ist und heute noch in einigen traditionellen asiatischen Kulturen eine Rolle spielt.3. Kot besteht aus nicht resorbierten Anteilen der Nahrung, aus körpereigenen Substanzen sowie aus im Darm lebenden Mikroorganismen, der Darmflora. Erstere sind vor allem die unverdaulichen Ballaststoffe, aber auch unverdaute Reste wie Fette, Stärke, Bindegewebs- und Muskelfasern sowie jene Menge Wasser, die nicht in den oberen Dickdarmabschnitten resorbiert wurde. An körpereigenen Substanzen sind abgestoßene Darmzellen, Rückstände von Verdauungsenzymen und Schleim enthalten. Die Gallenfarbstoffe Bilirubin und Biliverdin werden im Dickdarm von Bakterien zu Sterkobilin, Bilifuscin und Mesobilifuscin abgebaut und ergeben die charakteristische gelblichbraune bis dunkelbraune Farbe. Geringe Mengen der Gallensäuren selbst sowie des zum Schutz der Darmschleimhaut von der Gallenblase ausgeschiedenen Lecithins und anderer Phospholipide werden zusammen mit dem Kot ausgeschieden. Der unangenehme Geruch des Kots von Allesfressern rührt von Indol und Skatol sowie von Alkanthiolen her. Diese entstehen bei der Verdauung von Proteinen. Auch Schwefelwasserstoff trägt zum Geruch bei; er wird beim Abbau der schwefelhaltigen Aminosäuren durch Fäulnisbakterien gebildet. Die – teils abgestorbene – Darmflora macht beim Menschen etwa 20 bis 30 % der Gesamtmasse des Kots aus. Sie besteht ganz überwiegend aus Bakterien; daneben sind in geringer Menge Hefen (Candida) und andere einzellige Eukaryoten vorhanden. Der Nachweis von Verunreinigung durch Fäzes erfolgt durch Fäkalindikatoren. Warum ich euch was zu Eiern und Kot rausgesucht habe? In Funky Forest scheißt Tadanobu Asano's Charakter, mitten im Wald, auf ein auffallend großes Ei. Dadurch erwacht der Geist eines ermordeten Yakuza (Susumu Terajima), der fortan, mit einem Scheißhaufen auf dem Kopf, in der Gegend rumsteht........ warum ich für Funky Forest: The First Contact hier etwas über Sperma eingefügt habe, findet ihr dann doch bitte lieber selber raus.

The process to prepare it is perhaps as important as the product itself, a ritual of sorts that imparts an indeterminable essence which makes it all the more agreeable and pleasant – steep it gratefully, stir it gingerly, strain it carefully, and breathe in its aroma lovingly.

The less you know, the better. Still here? One could describe The Taste of Tea as a Ghibli live action. It possesses the same listless pace of their countryside films, there is no real conflict or darkness and plenty of magic. The Taste of Tea basically is a portrait of a family whose members all are slightly eccentric. Especially Sachiko’s fantasies are a thing to behold; the scene on the porch with her grandfather is surreal comedy at its best. After the film is finished sunflowers will also never look the same again. A very special film by an underrated director. His strange and wild follow-up Funky Forest: The First Contact (2005) is a monument of out-there cinema.",3,4,3,199,208,22/3/16,rated-10

Katsuhito Ishii’s film The Taste of Tea centers around the Haruno family and is set in the countryside of Japan, showing a bizarre yet lighthearted slice of their life. In an interview with Kuriko Sato of Midnight Eye, Ishii says he just wanted to make a good “family story in which no big tragic moments happen.” For most of the film, Ishii achieves this. From the get-go, the world within the film adheres to its own absurd logic, with trains coming out of foreheads and manifestations of the characters as big as school buildings. Despite these surreal moments, the film radiates a tranquility that immerses the audience into the nonsensical world of the Harunos. Dennis Lim of the Los Angeles Times describes the film as “a magic-realist updating of Ozu.” With this idea in light, Ishii’s absurd family film perhaps details another way of Japanese living, one that stays true to many Japanese values but also breaks away and welcomes the strange, unexpected moments of life.    In many ways, by embracing the film, the audience embraces Japanese culture, from mono no aware to baseball. However, the film in many ways also deviates and even challenges the conservative nature of Japanese culture. Despite this, the film nevertheless retains a peaceful, bucolic atmosphere. Ishii achieves this with cinematography, repeatedly using slow cuts, long takes, and deep shots to engross the audience. However, the atmosphere is also engendered by the nonjudgemental, open-mindedness of the Haruno family, all of whom seem to tolerate and in many instances appreciate the unexpected and unconventional. As a result, what Ishii presents is an idealized version of Japan, one where eccentricity and liberal values are embraced and tranquility permeates the atmosphere. In one scene, the mother describes her hypnosis experience to her daughter: As though she is speaking for Ishii, the mother describes how it’s “somehow liberating to assimilate with that world.” The mother essentially describes the experience of watching The Taste of Tea. In accepting the film’s idiosyncratic logic, the audience can enjoy something serene and warm-hearted, along with a new, different Japan. It’s no wonder the film ends peacefully, with the characters gazing at the setting sun on the burning horizon instead of the rising sun, the very symbol of the Japanese flag. All the way to the end of the movie, Ishii reminds the viewers that this is a different Japan—and perhaps all the better for it.  *intro and conclusion from class paper*",3,2,0,47,43,6/5/20,rated-10

It is filmed in an almost documentary style, but is shot through with a beautiful and lyrical surrealism that is as funny as it is strange.  For instance, young Sachiko is followed around by a giant double of herself that noone else can see, and uncle Ayano spent his youth being observed by a bleeding tattooed man with a fresh turd on his head.  Both accept this strangeness as just one of those things. Katsuhito Ishii's tale is as languid and lethargic as the Haruno family's lifestyle appears to be.  It's deliberate pacing allows us to get under the skin of, and fall in love with, the family as they go about their daily lives.  It inevitably drags a little, as the good-natured anarchy of the opening forty-five minutes isn't maintained.  At two and a half hours, it is definitely at least fifteen minutes too long, and the plot (such as it is) meanders along.  It certainly isn't a story-driven film. That said, it is so beautifully shot, acted, and envisioned that is hard to care too much.  There are certainly worse lives than those of the Haruno clan to immerse yourself in.  It is a relatively little-seen movie, and one that deserves a wider audience.",4,22,0,"1,758","1,312",25-Feb-14,rated-8

This film is a happy place - it brought me back to this bundle of memories I had from childhood - about a park in a place called Santa Clara. I used to hang out with two of my twin friends and their older brother during a slice of my youth when I was too little, too naive to understand anything about the adventures we were getting ourselves into..still, this movie felt a lot like sitting on a swing in that park, the mundanity of it all, waiting for the banality of everyday life to fade away and always curious about the little things. Just happy to be sitting with those you cared about even if boredom could come to eat you whole.''The Taste of Tea'' feels very welcoming but never pushy, quirky in his own way. Just the type of film you watch for 2 hours and you're sitting there, delighted to have had the opportunity to spend time with these people. It takes on the surreal and uses it, abuses it, but not so much that it becomes a fantasy genre film. I'd even go as far as define it as a 'magical realism' type of media. One of our mains has a train leaving his forehead in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Our other main character is a little kid followed by a giant version of her head and body. The entire movie could be scrutinized and looked deeply into but I'm just not writing like that anyway.Curiously enough, this was my first watch upon my arrival in  Iceland, where I am living in a small village isolated and lonely for the most part, but glad to be making up something better for myself in the future.at least money wise. The film felt specially warm for that reason. Watching it felt a lot like a reminder - or maybe a warning - ''you're gonna be alright  here and you're gonna grow from these months. There will always be films. You're never not gonna be in love with them''I want to make films now more than ever.

We follow each member's journeys, particularly Hajime and Sachiko, of finding love, passion, and experiencing weird, random moments. The film has a calm and peaceful atmosphere, showing the countryside of Japan in many wide, beautiful shots that let's the audience take in the scenery. The characters don't talk a lot but when they do, it comes off more awkward than normal, especially for the character Hajime who's shy, timid, and lacks in human interactions. He resembles an ordinary teenager that's in love with a girl but does not have any courage to talk to her. He would rather just listen to his surroundings. He reminded me of myself back in the days so I kept rooting for him to succeed.The Taste of Tea is a film that doesn't really have a story. Not a lot happens during the run time but still is a delightful watch because of how awkwardly comedic it is. There are scenes where it just comes off so arbitrary but works for a film like this because it feels natural and intentional while the tone stays consistent.

I actually on average find the latter a lot more, if not interesting, at least pleasant to watch, in that the bizarre things happening seem less the efforts a person actively trying to impress you with their wackiness and more just the honest expression of the imagination of someone who's a bit unhinged. This is the ultimate example of that camp. The seams on the special effects show, but it actually helps the charm of it. I'd have to watch it again to try to figure out any real throughlines or themes in all the madness, and I almost certainly will.

I think I read that the story came from a comic, and nothing makes more sense because the whole vibe was pretty chaotic from start to finish. Diabolik and Eva are antihero partners in crime and romance, so of course they live in an underground space age lair that’s somehow also like, beachfront property. It is important to know that he wears various catsuits for most of the film. Together they complete fabulous heists and bomb tax offices with little regard for human life while driving matching black & white Jaguars. I’m not a car bro yet (it is merely a matter of time) but some of those sports models from the 1960s are *chef’s kiss* The film does focus too much on the bumbling police and the Mafia which are both after Diabolik. The gangsters are always surrounded by a bevy of beauties with no brains, resulting in a truly overwhelming number of shots that scream “male gaze” which does hold this back from getting a full 4 stars from me.

Still, the titular character is such a monumental dickhead that it beggars belief. That is true and it will always continue to be true, what with his utility belt to help him for whatever situation he may happen upon - whether that be shitty forward roles or ""so you've been cast in solid gold"" tablets.

The plot unfolds in a surprising manner with the involvement of a crime syndicate. This makes it much more complex than having the master thief chased solely by the law. It also lessens the blow of Diabolik’s murder and mass terrorism by having someone seemingly more ever appear as a counterpoint.  There is always a strong level of fun to the film even if the dialogue does not deliver. The way that the bureaucracy is shown is a highlight. The cinematography is also exceptional. From the opening shot of the oppressive guarding operation, to the lair, there is a strong vision. And that soundtrack! One weakness in the simplicity of the anti-hero. Beyond his infatuation with a gorgeous female and a love of wealth, he lacks any great traits. However this combination is presented in such an excessively hedonistic manner, it is hard not to smile.

This laser gun can melt anything...except you honey."" Is this the greatest comic book movie or just the best? From the first time I saw it being lampooned on the series finale of Mystery Science Theater 3000, this movie has held a complex and cherished place in my heart. Danger: Diabolik is at the confluence of many disparate aspects of cinema that I grow to appreciate more and more each year. The team of writers, artists, producers, and musicians behind the film have all left a nearly indelible mark on film history, and it's my go-to obscure cult favorite. But one can't properly contextualize Danger: Diabolik without bringing up the far more popular Barbarella, a staple of (if not the quintessential) camp film.  After all, the two films share star John Phillip Law and co-writers Brian Degas and Tudor Gates -mostly due to them both being Dino De Laurentiis productions. Of course, Laurentiis produced several of my favorite films of the 80s Conan: The Barbarian, Blue Velvet, and Evil Dead II, as well as films by other master directors like Bergman and Fellini. It is Laurentiis' involvement that both helped and hindered this schlock masterpiece. You see, Danger: Diabolik was intended as a quick, cheap ($ 120,000) flick for dredging up money to fund the more extravagant (most conservative estimate: $ 4,000,000) production of Barbarella.  Laurentiis' choice to direct this project was none other than the inventor of Giallo film, Mario Bava. Anyone who has seen Bava's earlier divergence from his slasher roots, Planet of the Vampires, would be well aware of the man's skill and ingenuity at creating an entirely other world with such a cheap budget. With literal smoke and mirrors (and a few matte paintings) Bava made a psychedelic neon planet to captivate even the most cynical 70's Doctor Who fan while staging what is essentially the premise and plot of Ridley Scott's Alien. Say what you will of any other aspect of Danger: Diabolik, but Bava's production design is immaculately colorful and expansive. From the overweening fascist motor police headquarters that open the film to Diabolik's groovy, Jaguar-filled, underground lair, the scale and detail of the sets, ironically, put that of the far more expensive Barbarella to shame. Let me be perfectly clear up front, I think Barbarella is a flat-on-its-face piece of trash. Sure, it's good for a chuckle, but in the context of the money spent on it, I'm flabbergasted at the the sheer waste of the whole thing. I mean, it's too boring and bored by itself to be even ironically good. It's a garish and tacky stage production that blends a completely banal space fantasy with non-sequitur visual design, and it was directed by an overpaid drunk who was all too willing to belch out ""Cut! That's a wrap."" If not for the completely over the top (and, admittedly, sometimes gorgeous) costumes and sets, this film's canister, filled with all of its sexual ""liberation"" and ""science"" fiction, would have been relegated to some Italian film exec's desk as an ashtray. Considering the unmitigated amount of influential import placed on Barbarella over the subsequent 50 years, I envy for Danger: Diabolik the financial priority placed on such a vastly inferior product.  So, what makes one schlocky comic book adaptation that much better than the other? For one, Danger: Diabolik is scored by Ennio Morricone. Since we're talking context, the year is 1968, and no big deal but this was the year he wrote for two of the greatest spaghetti westerns of all time: The Great Silence and Once Upon a Time in the West. While both of them are masterpieces in their own right and contain some of Morricone's most beautiful compositions, I can't help but tout the soundtrack to Danger: Diabolik as second only to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The cornerstone of the film lies in a very sexually charged, Bond-esque theme song ""Deep, Deep Down"", a tune containing the majority of leitmotifs that permeate the soundtrack. Plenty of vocal ""wah-wahs"" and surf guitar aid a truly psychedelic orchestra of bongos, electric sitar, and claves - ""psychedelic"", that is, if you don't prefer the Herb Alpert-esque lounge farts of the  Barbarella OST.  Then there are the sets. Then there are the set pieces. Then there's Eva, played by Marisa Mell, who is in my mind the 60's silver screen sex Goddess. Then there's character actor Terry-Thomas who would go on to play iconic roles in A Clockwork Orange and It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. Then there's the flagpole of French acting himself, Michel Piccoli, taking a pay cut for a little exposure early in his career. Then there's Adolfo Celi, perhaps more recognizable as Largo in one of my favorite Bond films Thunderball. And is that the first blurry ""pass the joint around"" panning sequence in movie history?  With all of these great connections, how could Danger: Diabolik end up as the focus of the penultimate televised episode of a show predicated on poking fun at bad films? Following the trend of pretty much every movie made in Italy until the 90s, ADR, or dubbing, was the most efficient way to make up for the loud noises produced by standard film making equipment at the time. As disjointed as it may seem, I really love dubbing in movies for the element of unreality added to the escapist proceedings, but I gotta say it looks and sounds a little cheesy. I really can see why people think this movie is crap, and maybe it is a little. Back in the day, there would be a domestic edit, an international edit, and (if it made the market) an American edit. With the American edit called simply Diabolik, you get such woeful lines as ""Is that Stud coming?"", but the 2005 Paramount Pictures DVD preserves the majority of the film, visually and vocally. The only thing holding it back from a concerted restoration is the fact that the master tapes - yes, the same master tapes of one of the best Morricone compositions - are possibly no longer extant. Well, perhaps upon the 50th year of the movie's existence we will get a higher quality restoration.  Diabolik blew up the financial institutions and wiped out debt before Fight Club. Diabolik was a cynical anti-hero based on a graphic novel before Batman, Deadpool, and Logan. Diabolik is the 1960's. It's beyond cult and camp and comic, and it really does prove that Italians do it better. Next time you think about wasting time on spandex man in CG, go ahead and find a decent copy of Mario Bava's Danger: Diabolik instead.

This is exemplar visual filmmaking -- a vibrant action movie with no interest in logic. Why does Diabolik acrobatically twirl leap and twist into his car rather than, more efficiently, just sitting down? Why does Bava take time to match the design of a telephone to an irrelevant background character's gold and sparkly dress? Because it looks good.

Not many movies (ie: none) just stop dead in their tracks to showcase a vehicle elevator/make-out session/psychedelic light show sequence, but when this one does, it's so invigorating that I thought I had actually died and gone to a cinematic utopia, one melded out of cool-ass gadgetry and the WOW image of making love with your girl as millions of dollars are scattered across your bed.

Yet while American comic book characters were either dismissed as kiddie fare or utilized to subvert the material into camp satire, other countries took their illustrated characters more seriously. In France, Fantômas had lived on movie screens and serials and began a modern cinematic run in the mid-‘60s, inspired by the James Bond films, which in their own way were England’s answer to a pulp comic character (despite originating in prose novels). And in Italy, the fumetti character Diabolik, created in the early ‘60s by sisters Angela and Luciano Giussani, became so popular that a movie adaptation was inevitable. These international characters had a flair for the theatrical and dramatic baked into their origins, and as a result, taking them seriously on screen didn’t mean making a dark, gritty, brooding film, but rather ones that translated that flashy, lavish style from the page that could be fun without making fun of itself.  That approach is precisely the one taken by director/co-writer Mario Bava in making Danger: Diabolik (or just Diabolik to Italian audiences—I suppose the “danger” helped give an indication of the film’s tone to Americans?). Originally, Tonino Cervi sought to bring the character to the screen, and a wholly different Diabolik film went before cameras for a full month before the plug was pulled for various reasons (financial, creative, etc.) When the bag was left held by producer Dino De Laurentiis, he decided to start over completely, and hired Bava, the director known as not only someone who could do a lot with a little but had an inherent fantastic visual style. Even at that point, the film struggled to continue, the casting of Diabolik’s lady love Eva Kant going through several actresses (including Catherine Deneuve!). Finally, Bava and De Laurentiis landed on John Philip Law and Marisa Mell, two perfectly cast actors who not only play the parts well but make them into their signature roles. Law uses his piercing blue eyes and expressive eyebrows to make Diabolik into the conniving, impossibly cool character he’s written to be, while Mell slinks around the screen like a cat, a superheroine and gangster’s moll all in one. The two are exquisitely gorgeous, and their chemistry is such that Bava simply lets them make out and touch each other for elongated periods—the fact that the actors dated at the time of filming is delightfully evident, and gives their relationship a charge that buoys the entire movie. It allows Diabolik to have a moral center of its own, a true loving relationship at its core, because otherwise this is the story of an out-and-out criminal, a supervillain who may not seek to murder or kill innocents but nonetheless is against the system and is only out for himself and his girl.  With his actors squared away (including an ensemble of even more evil heavies led by Thunderball’s Adolfo Celi and a parade of bumbling fools in positions of authority, including Michel Piccoli and the hilarious Terry-Thomas), Bava could focus on the look and style of the film, emboldened by the relatively large budget given to him by De Laurentiis (which Bava only uses a fraction of!). The director and designers Flavio Mogherini and Piero Gherardi (with an assist from Carlo Rambaldi) create a color-saturated world of exaggerated spaces and forms for Diabolik and Eva to romp around in, letting reality fall by the wayside in favor of bold visual statements—the film’s central visual of Diabolik and Eva making love in a pile of money while their settee rotates around the room is the film’s ethos wrapped into a single image. Bava’s skill with traveling mattes, hanging miniatures and other in-camera trickery creates some fantastic imagery without ever betraying their low budget nature, and even the obvious blue screen and projection shots feel of a piece with the movie rather than blights, the whole thing taking place in an unnamed fantasyland. The movie’s score by Ennio Morricone is unabashedly swinging ‘60s-flavored, yet delightfully so, each new melody Morricone comes up with catchier than the last. The film’s earnest approach to outsized style and fun (Bava loves his zoom lenses!) is what may have made it a “camp” classic in the reflexively serious ‘90s—“Mystery Science Theater 3000” and the Beastie Boys capitalized on the film’s awkward dubbing (the result of missing audio tracks during that decade before the originals were found again later) and its intentional outrageousness. The film is also so indebted to its source material that adapting full passages from the comics outright leaves it feeling too episodic, writers Bava, Adriano Baracco, Dino Maliki, Brian Degas and Tudor Gates simply transposing the Giussani’s source material in some cases. Yet Bava is careful never to turn the film into a parody, intentionally using humor to point at the movie’s satiric targets of law and order—this is a gleefully anti-establishment film, making Diabolik a semi-Robin Hood figure during an era when governments were hopelessly, publicly failing their citizens. The film’s humor also extends to its innuendo, pushing the envelope of on-screen depiction of fetishes—not only is Diabolik’s costume a version of bondage gear (which he continues to use after the authorities have seen his face, thereby negating the need for any identity-obscuring wear), but the film ends with a device that creates a literal golden shower. It’s this latter image—Diabolik’s greed and lust wrapped into one—that overwhelms him in the finale, yet only temporarily. Like the comic book movie itself, Diabolik’s appetites can’t be contained for long.",4,4,0,107,201,18-Jun-20,rated-10

Mario Bava is for my money one of the all time greatest directors. ""Black Sabbath"", ""Kill, Baby, Kill"", ""Blood and Black Lace"", ""Black Sunday"", ""Bay of Blood"", ""Planet of the Vampires"". And that's just scratching the surface. The guy has made more masterpieces than most directors have made films. But a bubblegum, 60s cops and robbers does not suit him. To be fair, it looks and sounds as great as you'd expect, and creatively producer Dino de Laurentis is said to have taken creative control a lot during the production, so I guess we can't squarely place the blame on Bava. But this was a chore to get through.  The story and characters are inane and the dialogue horrid. I am not sure why I should care for a protagonist that is a thief, murderer and eventual psychotic terrorist who spends his free time literally boning his model girlfriend on top of a big pile of money that they freely admit they don't need. No Robin Hood antics or lovable Lupin III style buffoonery. Just a sociopath murdering his way through the police to get gold and jewels to give to his supposed great love (with whom he has ZERO onscreen chemistry, I might add). The whole thing plays like a (intentional) comedy free version of ""Austin Powers"" without anyone to root for. Maybe if I knew the comic book, I would understand the character better, maybe know a hint of backstory or motivation. But on its own, I was cheering for the cop, the only halfway sympathetic character in the film, to get him.  What a disappointment this film was.

Diabolik (John Phillip Law) is just a giant dick, just tormenting and terrorizing anyone and everyone except for his girl Eva Kant (Marisa Mell). Actually, he torments everyone and anyone because of his girl. Love will make you do some crazy shit - like steal 10 million....or blow up every tax building in the country....or steal 20 tons of gold....or an emerald necklace....or, perhaps, kill yourself for exactly 11 hours and 57 minutes. You know...normal love stuff. There was a smattering of great cinematography throughout; the opening sequence was fantastic (geometrically speaking) with great framing choices utilizing the mammoth building and its lines to its full potential. Then Bava and Antonio Rinaldi take it a step further with the glorious port sequence that features some slick camerawork. The only other sequence that captivated me would be the necklace heist that quickly morphs into hilarity involving a catapult. Ennio Morricone kills it...again. Is there a film with original music from Morricone that isn't spectacular? I'm not even talking a bad score, just an average score that elicits a meh maybe. I found it hilarious that Diabolik says that ""in his suit he could swim through the center of the Earth"" then flips down his little plastic face mask which doesn't even fully cover his face.

After enjoying but not really seeing what most people seem to see in A Bay Of Blood and thinking that Rabid Dogs was a load of old knackers, I hoped that Danger: Diabolik might be the film that got me connecting with his work. But no. I can certainly appreciate what people see in Danger: Diabolik. It's so deliriously daft and ineptly acted and bizarrely shot and ludicrously plotted and then squashed together into a mound of 1960s kitsch by Bava that its charms are actually pretty obvious to see even to someone who didn't think it was all that interesting. For me, however, there just wasn't quite enough happening here. In between some pretty entertaining action scenes and the odd scene of Terry-Thomas cackling insanely and Adolfo Celi disposing of naysayers, there is far too much plodding nothingness going on here and most of the first half an hour sees John Phillip Law having it away with Marisa Mell. Nice work if you can get it, but it does start to become very dull very quickly. It's just rather stop-start and I did nod off at one point and had to rewind it to see what I missed. The answer was not a great deal actually, but at least it rounds off with a pretty good and clever ending. Michel Piccoli does not get nearly enough to do as well whilst Law is absolutely dreadful in the lead role - not nearly as engaging and exciting as he was in, say, The Golden Voyage Of Sinbad. It wasn't bad and it had its moments, just not enough of them. At least it reminded me to watch the Beastie Boys video for Body Movin' again.",6,14,4,469,"10,151",5-Feb-14,rated-5

The (arguably) grandfather of the giallo genre, Mario Bava, dips his feet into the action and early comic book genre with great success, as he does a great job capturing the spirit of the many exploitation films of the era. Some of his horror sensibilties can be subtly be seeing spread throughout the film, many in the way of the visual and camera work, from quick zoom ins and closeups that will later become a staple of the genre on the 70s. The score by the one and only Ennio Morricone also walks the thin line between what we've come to love from him with his spaghetti western (can't tell me those chorus are reminiscent of The Man With No Name trilogy) all trapped in this very rock and psychedelic soundtrack that's very in line with the work of John Barry and Monty Norman for the 007 features. Performance wise, John Phillip Law as the titular character was simply magnetic - it seriosly had me wanting for more of his work. Marisa Mell was simply eye candy, while she also has some good sass that put her above your run-of-the-mill Bond girl. And last but not least, Michel Piccoli was also really great as the inspector attempting to stop our man of mystery.

This movie has no right being as good as it is, but damn, every single minute of it is straight up fun and had me smiling all the way through. It does drag a bit near the end, though. Otherwise, this would have been a perfect horror-comedy. The way the film centers on the friendship of these two young sociopaths is its strongest point. Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp's chemistry together is off the fucking charts. They're a joy to watch. I'm so down for a sequel it's not even funny.

While Patchwork had some good laughs in it, it was a rougher picture, erring on the lower budget side of things. With his follow up effort it seems that he's found a better stride, tightening the screws and smoothing out the roughness. The movie is stylish and hip, but manages to keep from abusing these aspects too much, which is good. Tragedy Girls stars Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp, both of whom are hot off Marvel property popularity (Shipp in X-Men: Apocalypse and Hildebrand in Deadpool) and I think it's likely that their careers will continue on. They've got a lot of chemistry together and both are charmingly snarky and trendy throughout this movie. The supporting cast has a lot of familiar faces too, like Josh Hutcherson and Craig Robinson, who are memorable despite fairly short appearances. There are a few awkward performances outside of these (Jack Quaid, another Hunger Games alum, didn't really wow me) for the most part every plays well off of each other and allows the quirky, dark humor of the script to work. There are tons of references and throwbacks to be found here, which is fun meta humor for horror fans, and I got a pretty strong Heathers vibe from a lot of the movie (with snippets of Yoga Hosers but only the good parts: the very few good parts). Which may kind of be part of my issue with it. Similar to my feelings with Heathers, it can be very humorous but also very dark. While I felt Tragedy Girls leaned more into the comedy for most of the movie, it has moments that felt mean spirited and harder for me to enjoy. Unlike Heathers, which has moments of self awareness about its own depravity, this film doesn't really go there. It retains a poppy, humorous aesthetic even over its darker moments (such as the finale) and personally, it didn't quite work for me. It's just a tad bit in bad taste. Still though, I certainly got a few laughs out of the movie, and though the makeup effects are cheesy as hell, some of the kills are a ton of fun. They're classic slasher style kills, stylized by the awkward and accidental nature of their accomplishment, which makes most of the scenes really entertaining to see play out. The camerawork is effective, not especially remarkable but I didn't feel there were any markedly poor moments in it's movements or editing. True to the hip teenage aesthetic, the score is loaded with licensed pop songs, which I imagine will be hit and miss for most. I found a few of them obnoxious, and mixed a little loudly (which is kind of typical for this sort of thing) but overall it was acceptable in the scope of the film's aesthetic. I had fun watching Tragedy Girls. It wasn't mind blowing or gut busting, but it keeps a crisp pace with the laughs, kills, and a few twists and turns. If you enjoyed Patchwork, or even the recent and stylistically similar The Babysitter, I think you'll find plenty to be entertained by here as well.",5,22,0,"1,841","2,042",23-Jan-18,rated-7

But trust me, you are missing out on some truly life changing storytelling.  Watching this movie is a lot like being a lower class family on the Titanic in two ways. The first being that I am a college student who watched this movie at ""The Grove"". Now if you were like me, naive, alone, and found yourself in Hollywood for the afternoon, you might have thought ""The Grove"" is a friendly, quiet, neighborhood, independent theater that plays hip, cool, and fun movies such as Tragedy Girls on a Friday afternoon for Isaak-with-his-little-cup-of water-that-he-always-asks-for-because-he-is-too-cheap-to-pay-for-soda. Well, my dear friends, ""The Grove"" is not this fantastical establishment I had envisioned. Imagine whatever you think the epicenter of the Apocalypse is right? Now build a parking garage for it that makes LAX's look like a strip mall. You have got the Grove. Gucci people in the millions. Convertibles and sports cars in the billions. Does that math add up no but NASA did a census and ruled that a literal mathematical measured metric fuck-ton of people were at my small, quiet, indie theater. My god, let me tell you driving into this parking garage gave me 'nam flashbacks to parking at the Microsoft headquarters.  Anyway you park and go down these glass elevators (because I can assure you, you can forget any silly children ideas you had about parking below the 5th floor) into what I realize ""The Grove"" really is. A FUCKING 12 STAR HOTEL! I was genuinely worried I wasn't rich enough to use the restroom, but I did and immediately reached a climax, meaning I climaxed but also my life will never get better than this hotel's bathroom. Did you know rich people don't use paper towels? I didn't, why use that when someone has pre wrapped real 300% cotton towels for the general public to wipe their hands with?I felt like I had ascended to some higher status of life-form. Then you walk out of the restroom and you realize that when you walked into the restroom, you forgot to even pee because the hand towels were so cool but nothing matters anymore. You walk out of the hotel, and then you really, really realize the true nature and the magnificence of what ""The Grove"" is.   a mall  it's another mall.  BUT not just any mall, a mall where Nordstroms is the cheapest store, a mall that has it's own tram system, .... A Mall, that is it's own society, its own way of life. The Grove is not a destination, it's a way of thinking, to dictate your life. I thought Burbank with it's ""Mall District"" a stretch of land spanning like a mile in length was nice?  Nah, fucking nasty woman fake news trash.  Downtown Pasadena with it's cheap parking, two story Target, and Playhouse?  Only if you don't respect yourself, because ""The Grove"" is the alpha and omega of spending waaaaaaaaaaaaay too much money on something.  I get now why aspiring actors are drawn to Hollywood. It's just for a small, borderline insignificant, chance to be able to get rich enough to shop at ""The Grove"". Do you really think Emma Stone gives a shit about winning the academy award?  No she just wants to shop at ""The Grove"" and priority parking.  Anyway then you walk into the theater, and it's like a REAL theater, with a staircase assumedly made out of solid gold, and ticket prices starting at 17 U.S. dollars. If I didn't have Movie Pass, I would have done my throwing up blood/impure whores routine and got the hell out of dodge. But I got my ticket, got my little free cup of water as I do, accidentally walked into a group interview, and when everyone realized my mistake began laughing, and it was like that scene from Requiem for a Dream where the studio audience invades that lady's apartment and she can't escape because she is trapped in by their mocking and the flashing lights, but I escaped and finally made it to the safety of Tragedy Girls.  That is the first way watching Tragedy Girls is like being a lower class family on the Titanic. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The second way watching Tragedy Girls is like being a lower class family on the Titanic, is because HO-LE-EE SH-EE-I-TT this movie is worse than spending the rest of your life savings so your family can start again in America, only for the ""unsinkable"" ship to be like ""Ta-da bitches unsinkable my ass!"", AND THEN, come to realize that no one cares about you, and even if you can make it from the bottom of the boat to the top, everyone else does the ""fuck you I'm a rich/suck on my singular Gucci"" routine and gets to revoke your ""lifeboat privileges"" so you end up drowning alongside your inconsolable wife who holds your infant child the whole way down, and it isn't romantic or sad like in James Cameron's Titanic, it just sucks the whole time, and then you die a cold and horrible death that could have been avoided, but serves as a proper end-cap to the terrible poverty stricken life you led up to that point.  ""You can’t make an omelet without killing a few ex-boyfriends.” Is a real quote from this movie. Some hack, (ahem) HACK, film reviewer at Collider wrote that the film is a ""slick"" movie ""with style to spare""  Right?  WRONG!  SO FUCKING WRONG! (note: everyoneisentitledtotheirownopinionscollider'sisjustwrong) I heard someone compare this to being something along the lines of a Disney Channel original movie that is also a hard R-rated horror comedy, and that is literally the best way to describe it. Though I would also say it's a lot like Heathers, but not funny, and regardless of whether you like Heathers, way worse than that. Anyway when I heard that I got excited because I thought it was going to be a satire, but no, it is literally just the worst thing ever.  It is not ""stylish"" at all, just overly colorful, but used in really ugly and forgettable ways. I know I'm going to sound like an asshole, but color has to be used in ways so that emotions can be dictated to the audience subconsciously. I think how an artist uses color to complement the story and beats in a scene within a movie is the most important thing, and this movie is like a big fuck you in that regard. It's like someone just took a paint bucket and threw random colors  over everything, and then it's just really gory for no reason. I would guess the director would say it's like dark humor, but when the whole joke is that they cut off some girls head and stuck it on a drill so it spins around, it's not funny, its just super lame. Also the main characters are so shallowly written and uninteresting to watch. They pretend to be these two outsiders who are edgy because they say the fuck word and obviously are going around murdering all these people. The whole first half of the film is devoted to just them trying to murder people so they can get a larger social media following.  It was sooooooooooooooooooooooo boring to watch them do these rinse and repeat serial killer type murders for the first roughly 45 minutes of the movie. Especially the one with Craig Robinson, which it's like first, why Craig, why you got to do this thing to me, but its just filler, and the movie is only 90 minutes. You got like an hours worth of real, trashy human garbage content here, and a half an hour of filler trashy human garbage. In conclusion, don't stick the Portlandia theme in your movie, it's weird.  Also Trash Girls is an incoherent cluster-fuck, which is saying a lot because I watched Charlottes Gainsbourg dry hump Michael Fassbender's tummy only for him to give everyone blank stares in return and read a teleprompter for 2 hours this week as well. Also if anyone that works for management at ""The Grove"" is looking to do a commercial I am soooooo down dude.",34,25,12,47,218,21-Oct-17,rated-1

In this instance, those characters are McKayla & Sadie (their surnames are Hooper and Cunningham, because of course they are), two high school girls who've abducted the local serial killer so that they can continue his killing spree, believing it'll be good for the numbers and likes on their true crime website and its associated social media accounts. And so, they kill their classmates and students, and then report on the murders in amusingly inappropriate fashion, all perfect makeup, short skirts and hashtags galore. It's a cute idea, though I think by now that there have probably been enough stories about millennials prioritising Tumblr popularity over normal standards of decency and morality. Likewise, McKayla & Sadie's constant air of ironic detachment is nothing new; it's been with us for three decades now, arguably originating with and perfected by Heathers back in 1988. That's not to knock Alexandra Shipp & Brianna Hildebrand's performances though: they're both very believable and full of screen presence.

At the center of the film we have the '80s unstoppable hulking mass villain pit against the post-Scream, '90s teen/best friend-villains, and I love how it feels like two scripts crashing into one movie.  The people who made this did so with care, just when you think ""this is exactly like Scream,"" a high school student portrayed by an actor well into their 20s pops up which was commonplace in '80s slashers.  There's the obsessed horror fanatic who is also the child of the local sheriff, a typical slasher character from both decades fused into one.  It isn't perfect but I found myself enjoying it more and more as the movie went on and by the end I was surprised by the genuine cleverness layered throughout (and this is just what I picked up on first watch), there are tons & tons of references but you don't even need to be familiar with them to enjoy this breezy buddy slasher.

And yet, it's a shame that it sits rather awkwardly throughout. From the get-go things are offbeat, abrasive, and incredibly rushed—in fact, it's all too much to take in and appreciate, thanks to the poor writing and obnoxious take on social media, not to mention its annoying anti-hero leads. Failing to get anything satisfying satirical right about the horror-slasher-comedy genre it runs with, Tragedy Girls rightly serves as an average and then some 2017 release.  At times, the film follows the stance of a MTV satirical high school series, making its mediocrity stand out even further. However, at its third act the film reaches peak entertainment, and by the end it feels somewhat worth the watch. It even sneakily slips in a few horror homages—one being surprisingly thrown at Cannibal Holocaust of all films. But, the main thing that hassles the film is its lack of producing compelling lead characters—the same ones that take pleasure in setting-up murder to increase their social media popularity. Yup. A terribly fucked up friendship—and one that could have been a lot better explored.  2.3/5",4,8,1,595,909,21-Feb-18,rated-5

At first I felt as if this film didn't quite know what it wanted to be, but then I realized it knew exactly where it was trying to head all along. It was just in a direction I cannot handle. It's a weird mixture of hipster tween humor & edgy serial killer lore. Much like The Final Girls, which was very well made, it seemed to not be made for anyone in particular. It was a slasher movie that had no gore, no nudity and no foul language even though it teased all three as being on screen, not to mention made for people raised on such horror tropes. Though this film is a Hard R, it's very bright and chippy with random brutal death scenes scattered around, always to be followed by cringey twee jokes and a forced millennial overtone. It's actually really lame.  Furthermore, It's also billed as a movie where two girls kidnap a serial killer in hopes of him mentoring them as his sidekicks. Never does this really happen, nor do they explain why they like serial killers nor why they are so well educated on the subject. They just are, they just know of him and they in turn just go through with murdering tons of people on their own when he refuses to teach them as originally planned. This movie makes no sense and tends to lean more toward the, ""Look, i'm edgy and bloody just because"" territory rather than focusing on telling a good story that makes us care for its incredibly shallow characters.

It puts an original spin on traditional slasher themes with strong performances from a solid cast, some clever horror film references and impressive practical gore effects thrown in for good measure... But... I found it virtually impossible to generate any level of empathy for the central characters.Yes, it's a commentary on the Gen Z mindset of ""Likes = Popularity & Fame"", but the utter narcissism and lack of compassion from characters that we are somehow supposed to relate to meant that there was little emotional investment in their destiny.

Often time, these desires drive us towards reaching our greatest achievements and realizing our full potential - the welcome irony in that what could be perceived as selfish wants, do in fact turn out beneficial, inspiring those around as a result of the acts propelled by them. And then there is the other side to that. A much darker side. Framed against mania and obsession, and motivated by superficiality - even if the desires themselves are pure in nature or born from some level of goodness, can still very much lead to an absolutely disastrous, if not deadly outcome. Or, if the ones looking to fulfill these desires are simply...broken, positive fortune is then inevitably turned into, Tragedy. Tyler MacIntyre's mean-spirited - yet playful - feature is a darkly sardonic examination of this; through the lens of modern social media culture, it ultimately asks some very disturbing, very relevant questions. Brianna Hildebrand and Alexandra Shipp (both of which coincidentally, have starring roles in X-men related films) do an admirable job playing the titular BFF partners-in-crime Sadie Cunningham and McKayla Hooper. Their ping-ponging glib, proudly brandished irreverence, and combined obsession with social media status comes across as the flimsy, worrying kind of shallow infrastructure on which their relationship is formed; at least on the surface. You wouldn't have guessed it given their common vice, but the glue which bonds their friendship together is surprisingly potent - and given the frequency at which the film attempts to drive a wedge between them, it seems to be an especially important part of the overall narrative. In fact, it very clearly is, and by the film's end, the ""Tragedy"" in Tragedy Girls will have gained much more meaning than it initially started with. Now, there's an obvious attempt at keeping things light, evidenced by the tongue-in-cheek script, the frivolous way in which violence and death are tackled, and the caricature-like cliche of a supporting cast; and it's wholly appreciated given the subject matter, but the skin-deep smiles and winks that Tragedy Girls likes to wear on its sleeve work doubly so as indicators for the darker nature of the film's themes. Remember earlier the questions I alluded to, and the concepts they're framed against? ""How do we measure self worth?"", ""Who will remember me when I'm gone?"" ""What am I, if not the likes on my Facebook posts?"" ""What's wrong with having heroes?"" Context is key here. Otherwise what seem like harmless - yet important - questions, become tainted with a chilling cause and even more chilling answers. ""By taking a count of our victims"", ""Those we've destroyed, and their loved ones"", ""A sociopath"", and ""Nothing, except when it's Ted Bundy and Ed Gein"". ...this review sounds bleak and mopey, but it wasn't intended to, I swear. In fact, this was easily one of the best horror films I've seen in the past few months, so ultimately a very positive experience. It's just that it's hard to ignore the obvious, or at least what I believe to be the obvious. Perhaps there's some projection here, given how much this site - which is a deep love of mine - relies on the proliferation of social media and exposure within (those likes and shares really do matter, right?). Not to mention it being rooted in horror...   ...Tragedy Girls almost feels like an admonishment, one which hits pretty close to home. And much like Sadie and McKayla's victims, I honestly didn't see it coming.",7,13,1,384,778,16-Jan-18,rated-8

And there is the whole BFF character arcs that comes to a hard stop on the rule, chicks before dicks, which certainly puts paid to any notion of toxic femininity. These girls are certainly no obedient, weak and marginalised little girls who know when to be quiet and mind their place. Also, the story is refreshingly original with some twists I didn't see coming. But... I don't think the actresses quite pulled it off. Megan Fox in Jennifer's Body nailed it. She was a cool as fuck, psycho-killer bitch, dripping with sex and sporting a massive fuck you. In contrast, these girls were just irritating.

At the center of the film we have the '80s unstoppable hulking mass villain pit against the post-Scream, '90s teen/best friend-villains, and I love how it feels like two scripts crashing into one movie.  The people who made this did so with care, just when you think ""this is exactly like Scream,"" a high school student portrayed by an actor well into their 20s pops up which was commonplace in '80s slashers.  There's the obsessed horror fanatic who is also the child of the local sheriff, a typical slasher character from both decades fused into one.  It isn't perfect but I found myself enjoying it more and more as the movie went on and by the end I was surprised by the genuine cleverness layered throughout (and this is just what I picked up on first watch), there are tons & tons of references but you don't even need to be familiar with them to enjoy this breezy buddy slasher.

It's a geek show of revolting imagery and absurdist comedy provocation. Everyone casually wears makeup to look diseased and filthy, all new orifices are plundered for sexual pleasure, excrement and fetuses and rape and music video vignettes and beyond-Lynchian nightmare abstractions get swirled into a supposed anthology that plays more like one long senseless loop of hopscotching dream logic.

It's got to be the most disgusting, wild, silly, creative, and original movie I've seen in a very long time and really badass for a debut feature at Sundance. So many of my favorite people are in this thing including Tim Heidecker, Hannibal Buress, David Firth, Busdriver, George Clinton, and Aphex Twin. I love a lot of the CGI, animation, visual effects, and the magazine collages of body horror imagery as well as the soundtrack accompanying them. Don't get me wrong though, there's a ton of disturbing and extremely graphic scenes even I couldn't stand watching. However, I still find this movie to be inspiring in a way.  I've been a fan of Steve's musical output as Flying Lotus and his rap alter-ego Captain Murphy as well as the visuals for his music. Seeing him grow from a bedroom producer to now as a film director really inspires me as an artist. Right now, I'm just creating artwork and music in my bedroom, but I hope to one day become a film director like him creating unique and unforgettable movies such as this (though less disgusting lol).  This isn't a film everyone is gonna love and that's totally fine. I'd rather see a lot of strong reactions from something like this rather than mediocre ones.

Nacido Steven Ellison, este músico angelino es conocido por hacer algunos de los discos más vanguardistas de los últimos años, apadrinar en su sello Brainfeeder al grueso de gente que hace música en los márgenes del academicismo o del pop —Kamasi Washington, Iglooghost, Mr. Oizo— y colaborar con básicamente todo bicho viviente que se haya hecho un nombre yendo a la contra del gusto general. El último de ellos, Shinichirō Watanabe, para quien hace la BSO de Blade Runner 2022. Por eso no extraña que entre sus locuras la última haya sido haya sido la filmación de esta película: Kuso. Como un cruce entre la estética de Adult Swim y el ero-guro pasado de vueltas de Shintaro Kago, Kuso es un monstruo de frankenstein donde cabe todo siempre y cuando quepa la posibilidad de cruzarlo dentro de una narrativa mínima, pero presente: un terremoto destruye la ciudad de Los Ángeles, aislando a la gente en sus sótanos y refugios, mientras una extraña enfermedad se propaga por toda la ciudad. De ese modo, en las cuatro historias cruzadas que se van desarrollando a lo largo del metraje, hay sitio para lo psicodélico, lo animado, lo musical e incluso el drama, el romance y el terror, con un reparto de auténtico lujo (George Clinton , Hannibal Buress), en el sentido más canónico del cual le es posible al bajo presupuesto del que disponía Ellison. Es decir, ninguno.  Con segmentos que parecen animes alucinados en imagen real y los mejores momentos disputándose en segmentos à la Adult Swim alargados hasta el exceso, el mayor logro de Kuso es su atmósfera. Su poética. Cómo en ese desastre narrativo capaz de producir un asco infinito —hasta el borde, literal, del vómito— es posible construir algo que, a su modo, logra atesorar cierta belleza. Belleza de pústulas, drogas y desconcierto, pero belleza. Prácticamente vanguardia. Algo que, si bien no deja de ser un desastre sin pies ni cabeza, hace imaginar lo que podría hacer Ellison con las tres cosas que le faltan: experiencia, presupuesto y algo que contar.  A fin de cuentas, dos de esas condiciones son circunstanciales. Y algo que contar siempre tiene, como demuestran sus discos. Pues si bien Kuso es incómoda, vomitiva, extraña, a ratos aburrida y fascinante prácticamente todo el tiempo, no deja de ser un ejemplo de cómo la estética de la belleza no sólo se da en los museos y en la estetización incluso de lo feo. También el material de derribo, lo impuro y lo feo puede ser bello por sí mismo. Ya que, como nos demuestra Kuso, tal vez la verdadera belleza resida en las pústulas reventadas.",5,8,0,58,357,6-Sep-17,0

This is a dadaist style bad trip, that fuses the body horror of David Cronenberg, the surreal worlds a David Lynch film would have, a dash of Gummo, and some weirdo show you might stumble upon on Adult Swim. There is next to no point in attempting to follow the plot as there isn’t much there and what is supposed to be isn’t made all that clear. There are a ton of disorienting animation segments, this bounces in and out of music video structure. The cast is an impressive ensemble but minus George Clinton (who even has his oddity amplified) are not recognizable as mutants, body horror abominations, or interdimensional creatures. Practical effects, while disgusting at times, are always well made but the same can’t be said for the CGI which is hit or miss. For music there is not only Flying Lotus but the legendary Aphex Twin and Akira Yamaoka crafting an appropriately surreal soundtrack for a surreal vision is a delight.

Kuso, a film billed as a body-horror comedy, is one of his greatest achievements and encapsulates everything that is wonderful and weird about his work.  The loose premise for Kuso is that Los Angeles had a devastating earthquake and the surviving inhabitants have mutated and are stricken with an unknown disease. I say ""loosely"" because while there is an underlying narrative, the film is more like a collection of vignettes than a cohesive story--though the different characters do cross paths from time to time. The vignettes encompass many different styles to include animation (by Salad Fingers creator David Firth), computer animation by 3d Cool World, and some extreme horror and sexual elements. This is one of the most disgusting movies I have seen in a long time and it is filled to the brim with cum, shit, vomit, pus, and any other human body fluid you can imagine. I suspect some of it is done for shock value, but there is meaning and depth to the depravity underneath it all. Kuso has an Afrocentric vibe to it that permeates the look and some of the social commentary posed in the film. It helps if you imagine Kuso as more of a sandbox for artists to experiment in than a movie in the traditional sense. Kuso is the Japanese word for ""bullshit"" and while this sounds like a negative adjective for this film, it describes it perfectly. There is an internet term called ""shitposting"" wherein people post purposely low quality off-topic comments and memes to derail a conversation. Kuso is essentially derailing what people think a movie should be like. It's a bunch of insane and creative bullshit just for the hell of it. Does it all work? Not in the slightest, but I love this film for trying. I can now say I have seen an alien bug that lives in someone's asshole cure a man's phobia for giant breasts and my life is all the richer for it.   Kuso's music, which was composed by Flying Lotus, is fantastic--it's a mixture of trap music, acid jazz, ambient electronica and even some stock music thrown in (Ren and Stimpy fans will recognize one of the stock pieces used). It's just as nuts as the visuals and the perfect accompaniment. This film isn't for everyone, and your enjoyment of it will hinge on your tolerance for both surrealism and absurdist comedy.

After already establishing himself in the hip-hop, IDM, and (insert Pitchfork genre here) music scenes, Flying Lotus has finally given us a visual amalgamation of all of his favorite films, made it disgusting, and in so doing, created an extreme art-house flick that you have to love simply for all of the influences it wears on its sleeve. Unlike many avant garde offerings, there isn't really any sort of beauty to be found in Kuso. Instead we are presented with several interwoven vignettes concerning race, gender, sexual orientation, drugs, and media, all of which range from off-putting to revolting. It seems to take place in a post-pandemic, radioactive dystopia where every facet of day to day life has devolved into a ubiquitous, nihilistic poop joke. If you consider yourself a ""normal"" person, just don't even bother watching this film. It is not made for you, and you will be annoyed or unnecessarily disturbed by it. For fans of David Lynch, Troma movies, and Xavier: Renegade Angel, here is one I can't recommend enough.",1,20,0,"1,288","1,537",25-Jul-17,rated-10

I didn't bother to read the synopsis before watching, but it wouldn't have applied anyway; Kuso is a collection of sketches rooted in millennial-brand late-night anti-humor (no punchlines, no linear thought, etc.) piggybacking on contests of gross-out one-upmanship disguised as particularly perverse body horror.  If the sound effects borrowed from Grand Theft Auto and Mortal Kombat, the actual presence of people like Tim Heidecker and Hannibal Buress, and the willful, extravagant ineffability smeared, poured, jammed, and injected directly into the audience's eye sockets at every opportunity weren't enough to suggest a unifying theme for Kuso, I'll just lay it out there: this is a meme.  It's a big ol' slice of fried meme that you might see when you suddenly look at the clock to find that it's 2 am and you're in ""that"" part of YouTube, only it's somewhere between 86 and 105 minutes long.  It's the unwanted convergence of The Holy Mountain, Thankskilling, Ichi the Killer, and Eric Andre. This is easily one of the most physically repulsive things I have ever seen - but then, so are Organ and Imprint and I love those, and on the other hand a baby can be even more disgusting without even trying.  It can be high praise to sicken the audience and it's also not necessarily indicative of any actual artistic quality.  I did laugh for real a couple of times and some parts I did appreciate on a creative level, but this shot way past not being my cup of tea and into the realm of things I could do with never having heard of in the first place; I'm willing to brook only so much nonsense expelled in the name of committing to a bit or antagonizing artistic convention.  Kuso was not the least enjoyable or the most infuriating or nauseating movie I've ever sat through, but that is really not saying too much; it gets close enough that I'll comfortably never watch it again and never recommend it to my friends.",2,2,0,12,40,26-Oct-20,rated-3

A real D-list movie. Two D words I can't say  Kuso is, tho?  Disappointing or  delightful. I got enough of a whiff of this movie before going in to know what I was in for. Kinda. Mentally I'd prepared for the worst. And I think phenomenal DJ-turned-director Flying Lotus is trying to hit you with some of his worst. It feels like FlyLo is trying to do for arthouse horror what Riki-Oh did for the kung fu flick: turn everything up to 11 and soak it all in an excruciating amount of bodily fluids. It's intentionally horrible but undeniably artistic; it's an awful watch but if one of the purposes of art (and particularly surrealism like this) is to challenge and disconnect you from your own reality and plug you into something deeply different (there's those D words again) then it's also a successful viewing. The fact that the writer/director's performers all seem really committed to and understanding of his uh ""unique vision"" makes it even worse.  As as a filmmaker Flying Lotus is still making mix tapes and Kuso is another one, throwing us back and forth in its meta-mixing interweaving segments between many distinctive settings and soundscapes that pulsate with nauseating technical dazzle and imagination while engulfing you in them completely. And I guess if you're going to be transgressive and terrible toward your audience the way this film is, do it with countless creative ideas crashing and burning on the screen like some massive meteor shower the way this one does. It's so twisted it's almost delightful, but still far too disgusting to ever be that. There's a fetishism for graphic-to-the-point-of-alien depictions of bodily functions in Kuso that makes the stylistic kinks of Hitchcock and De Palma (or even Lynch & Cronenberg) look downright wholesome by comparison. It's as unsavory and unsettling to take in as most anything you'll find in the darkest corners of the internet that's still executed comically enough to be immediately understood as obvious satire (and there is a lot of satirical comment on society here it's just covered in so much human excrement you don't want to touch it, which is probably part of the joke). It's one of those films truly deserving of a beforehand reminder warning that there are things in life you can't unsee, and some of them involve George Clinton and a big friendly Burroughs-esque insect popping up out of his ass to say hello. I like Flying Lotus' music enough that I'm glad I finally watched this, but I don't think I'll be feeling much desire to return to it anytime soon, especially when I still need to give Captain Murphy's Duality a rewatch. For me Kuso is somewhere between either a) a film that could've been a masterpiece of art were it not so purposely putrid, or b) an absolutely atrocious movie only partially redeemed by its technical artistry. I don't think most other viewers are going to feel that struggle the way I did though; I wouldn't be surprised if this is one of those movies many people noped the fuck out of pretty quickly.

But Anne F's recent review mentioned that it was about to expire on Lovefilm Instant so I decided this was the time to finally get around to it.  Perhaps my dissatisfaction with this was because I had watched a near-perfect film (A Swedish Love Story) immediately before, and I would have loved more time to reflect - but that was difficult in an evening spent cramming in expiring movies. However, My Dinner with Andre was also a great disappointment, so perhaps the ""conversation film"" is just not my thing.  I enjoyed most of the segments in Coffee & Cigarettes which were obviously acted, especially Cate Blanchett's, and the story Renee - and the fantastical piece one about the White Stripes and their Tesla coil which was actually in the room. But those which were more like friends telling tall tales, chatting and riffing on ideas were not of that much interest as a spectator sport ... I'd rather listen to my own friends and/ or join a conversation myself. Even Tom Waits and Iggy Pop were a bit of a disappointment after a fairly funny opening couple of minutes.

On the outside, Coffee and Cigarettes looks like a mere anthology film that is only connected by the idea of people having some coffee and cigarettes. One could easily just see it as ""Jim Jarmusch gets together with his famous friends and makes a bunch of shorts"".  Instead, Jarmusch is actually making a commentary about human nature. Throughout all the ""Jarmuschy"" witticisms, this is a film about how we repeat ourselves, no matter how different we are on the outside. Characters repeat specific lines, shorts repeat subtle interactions. In his mild collection of short, Jarmusch repeats many of his themes from his earlier film Night on Earth. We all experience the same minutiae of day to day life, and we don't even realize it. Beyond the veneer of Jarmusch's style of cool, there's a really nice commentary on how even our individuality causes us to repeat what others do.",4,120,1,529,"3,944",23-Mar-13,rated-8

Now, that itself isn’t unique for Sweden, but the all-encompassing nature of the fika is something quite special, being a staple in almost every family as a way to get time for some conversations. The reason I bring this up is because the the action in Coffee and Cigarettes is (if you switch the cigarette for a sweet cookie) very much like this tradition. And the beauty of it is something Jim Jarmusch captures so gorgeously. I’d hesitate to call the film minimalistic (Jarmusch has done films more in that realm, such as his debut) but it’s so toned down in a perfect manner. Instead of being visually avantgarde, the film has a perfect sense of style to both create a beautiful still life and still have the focus on the conversations. A wonderful closure of my experience through Jarmusch features, Coffee and Cigarettes is a couple of beautiful vignettes capturing social life in all its absurd, sweet, cute, unique beauty.

Jim Jarmusch directs this 2003 black and white feature. Some great, and some not so great, these 11 shorts are definitely interesting and enjoyable at the least. Each short has a star studded cast with the likes of Roberto Benigni, Steve Buscemi, Tom Waits, Bill Murray, Cate Blanchett, Steve Coogan and more. I’m not going to go through all of the eleven shorts. But as I said before, some of them are very good like “Twins”, “Somewhere in California”, “Cousins”, and “Cousins?”. While others like “Delirium” and “Renée”, while not terrible, didn’t really do it for me. The best thing about the film is without a doubt the dialogue between the characters. It’s often funny and mostly realistic. If these characters sat down with each other for a cup of coffee and a cigarette, that’s probably how they’re going to converse. Some of the shorts have stories that aren’t really new or unique, but since you are so enamored by the dialogue, it really isn’t that big of a problem. Coffee and Cigarettes is certainly not a movie for everyone, as is the case with most Jarmusch’s work. If you’re not a fan of films that are mostly talk, then stay far away. However, if you’d like to see some characters just have a very well written conversation over a cup of Joe, then this is the film for you.",4,7,3,41,169,25-May-14,rated-7

This is my first time watching one of his movies. I’m really excited to see more of his work especially Patterson. The movie had eleven different conversations with the only similarity between them being that there was Coffee and Cigarettes. In this review I will take about each of the conversations separately staring with the first one. The movie had really good dialogue. It was shot in black and white and that added to the chill feel. It was just a really good film.  The first conversation was decent. Roberto Benigni was pretty good in it. The conversation was decent and basically they were talking about Roberto’s character going to Steven’s dentist appointment for him. It was pretty funny but it did make worry about the rest of the film. Thankfully there were some better ones. The second conversation was much better. It started off pretty good but it got better once Steve Buscemi was in it. Basically it included two twins. One was a good twin and the other was an evil twin or at least according to Steve Buscemi. He played a waiter who decided to have a conversation with them instead of doing his job. It was a really funny conversation and it was one of my favorites of the film.   The third conversation was also really good. This one included Iggy Pop and Tom Waits. The running gag of the conversation was they both said they didn’t smoke. They then said well when you don’t smoke it’s always okay just to have one. They were obviously smokers. They just both hid the fact. This was a pretty hilarious conversation. It wasn’t as funny as the last one in my opinion but it was still pretty good.  The forth conversation was also really funny. I always love grumpy old men in movies so it made me laugh a lot. The conversation was really funny. There was a kid that kept popping up and asking them for money. He kept spending it on stuff that they didn’t approve on. Also they were having an argument because one of them didn’t like that the other was smoking. He kept saying it was bad for him making the other really angry. It was just a pretty fun conversation.  I didn’t really like the fifth conversation. It wasn’t that bad but it took a bit away from the film. I didn’t find it all that funny and it was just not that good. It wasn’t horrible just not that good and I don’t really want to talk more about it as I just found it to be boring. Now I did really like the sixth conversation in the film. It wasn’t spectacular but it was refreshing after the last one. Basically it had two friends who had not seen each other in a while meet up at a diner. The one friend was confused on why the other asked him to come so he kept asking if something was wrong. The other said noting was wrong, he just wanted to see him again. He kept asking because he didn’t believe him. It was just a really funny conversation that made laugh a little bit.  The seventh one was really good and it was more serious. Care Blanchett played both characters. Both of them being cousins. One of them was rich and one of them was poor. It made you feel kind of bad for the poor one. The rich one didn’t really seem to like her as much as she said she did and she was much more fortunate. She just seemed to have the perfect life. The poor one didn’t seem to. She seemed to have a unlucky life. She didn’t have a lot of money or a family like the rich one. I just really liked this conversation as it was more serious than the other ones.  The eighth one was another conversation I didn’t really care for. It was kind of interesting but I didn’t really like it. It was about this guys Tesla Coil and I don’t know, it was okay. It didn’t work and he was confused on why. If felt like it was there to fill time.  The next conversation is also really good. This one had both Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan play themselves. I always love hearing actors talk to each other so this was very interesting. They were playing more fictional versions of themselves but still. It was also really funny because Molina showed Coogan that they were cousins. That weirded Coogan out and he thought he was lying. So he left the room after a bit. It was just a really hilarious conversation that was one of my favorite parts of the whole movie.  The tenth conversation was definitely my favorite. That was mostly due to Bill Murray. He’s just a phenomenal actor and I usually love him in everything he’s in. GZA and RZA were also in it. Their conversation with Murray was great. He was trying to hide his identity by being a waiter. He was very frantic because he had a lot of coffee. It was just hilarious. It had to be my favorite conversation in the entire movie. It made me laugh a lot.  The final conversation was also more serious. It had two old men and one of them was trying to here this song in his head. It was pretty beautiful. It did a great job at portraying how it was to be old. I just really liked this one. It wasn’t that funny like the others ones. It was more serious than some of the others ones. I really enjoyed this film. It had some really spectacular cinematography and performances. The conversations were really good. I just really liked it. Overall Coffee and Cigarettes is a great comedy/drama feature if many conversations. 🔙Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey 🔜Cars♻️🔜Bill and Ted Face the Music ",14,13,0,623,582,27-Aug-20,rated-7

The real question is whether the piece as a whole is strong enough to make the journey worth it. Here, there’s enough recurring motifs to create a unity, to make it more than just eleven short films strung together. Your mileage may vary, but personally I can see myself putting this on at a party, or just on a rainy day when I need to relax.

Seeing a new film of his in a downtown movie theater at the time must have felt like seeing a famous sax player in a small, dingy nightclub. His great films have that same hazy, up close and personal touch that a more intimate venue would feel like.  Coffee and Cigarettes is probably the most jazz-like of any of his features. So free wheeling and emmulating many feelings per vignette that it seems indiscernible from improvisation or just calculated albeit scatterbrained genius.   The film is a collection of shorts where characters, mostly playing themselves, share coffee and cigarettes. Its a setup that allows Jarmusch to film Coffee and Cigarettes almost effortlessly, letting his actors and unique quirks fill the black and white frames. Its a supremely relaxing experience but Jarmuschs writing gives the film that nicotine tick. That caffine buzz. That nervous bouncing leg.

Combine that with Jarmusch’s classic dialogue and his signature black and white cinematography, and you got yourself Coffee and Cigarettes.

Everyone shares similar problems regardless their age, class or nationality.

Sometimes pointedly fascinating, and other times boring in how it carries out, but always interesting conceptually. Jarmusch reinforces the motif too obviously at points, but it's never irksome; it's clear that we're watching a bunch of people act, but the conversations still feel naturalistic. This is evidenced in the comparison between the stellar Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan scene in comparison to the acting in like, the Jack and Meg White one, which was still cool because of how much I like the White Stripes. Even the noticeably worse vignettes are worthwhile because of their mood - the last isn't spectacular, but the dreariness is. I loved the Cate Blanchett one, and the Iggy Pop/Tom Waits conversation. Not to mention Steve Buscemi's monologue on Elvis' evil twin, and the opening Roberto Benigni segment that's mimicked later on in the great RZA/GZA/Bill Murray one. Oh, and the Reneé short ruled too.

I felt this with Coffee and Cigarettes. Jarmusch creates a perfect atmosphere. The dialogue has a particular rhythm to it that seems so authentic and faultless, making the characters feel realistic, constructing a feeling as though we, as an audience, are on the table having a coffee and a cigarette with them. I guess you could compare it to some of Tarantino’s dialogues.  I loved how it was shot, it felt so simple and real. The characters are great. I always choose characters over plot so this was perfect for me.  This is definitely something i’m going to revisit a lot.

None of the sections have anything to do with one another, other than an occasional repetition of some of the dialogue.  I think this movie is uneven, as are most films with this structure.  It seems that I always like some of the segments more than others.  So, I will give a brief description of each segment. 'Strange to Meet You' stars Roberto Benigni and Steven Wright.  It is an uncomfortable scene because of Benigni's inability to fully understand the English language, which is of course an act.  Wright sticks to his dry, irreverent humor. 'Twins' is about two young black people (one male, one female) who may or may not be siblings.  Steve Buscemi plays their intrusive waiter.  The discomfort here comes by Buscemi being ignorant to racial issues that may not set well with some people. 'Somewhere in California' stars Iggy Pop and Tom Waits.  Both of them play a version of themselves.  I like both of these musicians, as well as both of them as actors.  I thought this was the funniest of the segments.  The uncomfortableness here is that Waits finds everything that Iggy says to be condescending, even though Iggy doesn't mean it that way at all. 'Those Things'll Kill Ya' has to older Italian American's having coffee and cigarettes at a cafe.  One is breaking the others balls about his eating and smoking lifestyle.  They are joined by the mute son of one of the men.  This segment is ok, but it runs the joke into the ground, with very few laughs. 'Renée' is about a beautiful woman, and a waiter that keeps pestering her.  He is trying to hit on her, but she is having none of it.  The woman is indeed attractive, but the skit goes no where. 'No Problem' has two black men with accents that I couldn't distinguish where they were from.  I know I have heard it, but I couldn't say for sure.  Anyway, they meet because one of them invited the other.  The invitee thinks that something must be wrong, so he asks him over and over is something is wrong.  The other man keep saying that nothing is wrong, but the first person doesn't believe him.  This is a pretty funny skit as well, but it too runs a bit long. 'Cousins' has Cate Blanchett playing two roles at the same time.  She is playing herself, as well as her lower class cousin.  The discomfort here is in the cousin having jealousy towards her rich and famous cousin.  And Blanchett feeling guilty.  It is very interesting to see her play such different characters. 'Cousins?' stars Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan playing versions of themselves.  Molina announces that he has learned that Coogan is his cousin.  Coogan is freaked out by the meeting and pushes Molina away.  That is until Molina gets a call from director Spike Jonez.  Coogan then tries to make nice, but it is too late.  Very funny segment. 'Jack Shows Meg his Tesla Coil' has Jack and Meg White, and it is pretty much all summed up in the title.  The coil breaks and Meg tries to suggest what might be wrong with it.  The comedy and conflict of the the segment is that these musicians seem to know way too much about this weird electric device.  The bit is thin, but I like The White Stripe, so I enjoyed it enough.  I didn't even know Meg could talk. 'Delirium' stars GZA and RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan.  Their waiter is Bill Murray, playing a version of himself.  There really isn't any conflict in this segment, but it is strange and irreverent.  I enjoyed it quite a bit. 'Champagne' stars William Rice and Taylor Mead.  This section is the most bizarre and seemingly pointless of all of them.  It is the final segment, and I really can't make any sense out of it.  It is just these two guys sitting around talking.  They both have interesting voices, but it was sort of flat.  I guess I don't know how you would end a project like this in a better way. There is no reason to sit down and watch this all together.  I can imaging that all of these segments are available on YouTube.  You can watch them whenever you want, and in whatever order you want.",13,6,0,"1,049","1,505",12-Nov-16,rated-5

Forced on the run to save himself and the woman he is falling for he decides to reach out to his friends for back up. Frank and his friends aren't your normal retirees as they have been code named RED or Retired Extremely Dangerous by the CIA...whom they used to work for as black ops agents. Together they will have to figure out why they are targeted for execution and that will mean taking on their former employer and the new generation that run the agency. This was such a fun movie that put together an absolutely fantastic cast. It was nice to see Willis in a role where he wasn't just phoning it in...looking at you G.I. Joe and Expendables. Malkovich was hilarious and Mirren can pretty much do anything she wants. You could really tell the cast was enjoying themselves throughout filming this and why not with the story that they were given. The pacing was really good and the humor was ever present as the film doesn't take the stressful situations to seriously which perfectly plays into the older characters that have seen it all. The ending for this was a little rough and the moments spent paying tribute to the comic book origin weren't necessary. However all and all this is a fun movie to watch and will definitely put you in a good mood. I am giving this 4 out of 5 stars.,2,5,0,79,107,31-Mar-16,rated-8

The action is uninspired and the humour isn't particularly funny, but the final act is fun enough. There's probably an argument to be made about the glamourisation of CIA operatives (our lovable hero literally ""toppled governments"") but honestly RED is too shallow for this to matter. The film makes no sense and is filled with silly plot logistics. The early 2010s feels like a generation ago, with big films like this being so much smaller in scale and so filled with terrible music. The best thing in RED is the great cast, though it must be said that John Malkovich steals the show and has the most fun. However ultimately all that RED shows is that even older actors can be the leads in generic, bland action movies. 2010 Ranked",2,26,0,748,"7,956",29-May-20,rated-5

It was however a very entertaining action/comedy that reignited Willis's career and also gave John Malkovich the chance to show what a versatile comedic actor he was. Stealing the limelight from Willis, Freeman, Dreyfuss, and a terrific Helen Mirren, Malkovich got all the best lines and most of the laughs here. Mary-Louise Parker also showed her value as a supporting player for an old-fashioned caper film full of action and wisecracks from the old stagers who all seem to be having the time of their lives. Karl Urban proves there's life after LOTR with another fine turn as a CIA agent caught up in a conspiracy involving the Retired Extremely Dangerous agents of the title.

The biggest thing here is the absolutely enjoyable amount of action in this, which makes this so frantically-paced and stylish that there's so much to like just from this factor alone before getting into how over-the-top cheesy it all is. From the numerous shoot-outs that unleash swarms of flying bullets featuring weaponry of all styles and factors, handguns and small-arms fire to cannons and full-scale machine guns this one has a lot of enjoyable sequences that really play off the explosive amount of gunplay comes through this one. On top of that, the car chases and stuntwork on display is quite exciting and over-the-top as well, which really makes this one come off as quite exciting and thrilling throughout as the non-stop nature of the film's action scenes is off-played slightly by it's rather-high dose of comedy here with a ton of sarcastic quips and put-downs that are quite hilarious throughout as well as the jokes about being in the situation in their age which gets some nice physical comedy as well.

I am a sucker for a man-on-the-run story, and there’s something fun about one where the guy on the run is also smarter and stronger than everyone chasing him.  I love going on this journey, and Bruce Willis is the perfect guy for the lead role because he looks like someone who is getting older but could still hold up in a fight against anyone.  I like the layers of planning that go into all these operations, and how they carefully execute their plans so that they can continue to come out on top when faced with insurmountable odds.  I also think most of the comedy is solid, particularly with John Malkovich as the hyper-paranoid former agent who is constantly shown to be justified in his paranoia.  I also have to mention how much I always love Karl Urban, and his performance here was amazing. I will say, there are a lot of people being killed in RED, and many of them are government agents who are just doing their jobs.  You have to be willing to accept that the protagonists of the film aren’t all that concerned with killing other people and potentially causing some collateral damage as well.  Since the action and violence is so exaggerated and extreme I kind of accepted it, but when my mind starts to think too much about the film, then I realize these are more like anti-heroes than anything else.  There are also a few too many convenient last-minute rescues that started to make it feel like these people could do anything.  I can let a lot of that slide, though, since I know this is all based on a comic book and there’s an added suspension of disbelief in those stories.

It's a consensus I can't disagree with. While watching it, I couldn't even really put my finger on why I didn't REALLY enjoy this one because with this cast and this premise and no discernible major problems with it all, it really should have been fantastic. But there's something missing from it. I wonder if part of the problem is that the script isn't quite as sharp and funny as it could have been. John Malkovich as a recovering (enforced) LSD addict and massive paranoic should have been hilarious - but he's only pretty funny in places. The plot is good but seems to be lacking some bite early on. It comes to a very satisfactory conclusion, certainly, but the way the characters are dropped into the narrative, especially the wonderful Mary-Louise Parker, didn't feel as natural as it could have been. Then there's the fact that the shootouts seemed to be framed in this weird haze that made me wonder if *I* was the one on LSD. I just seem to have a whole pile of minor issues with this but nothing significant. They mount up though, preventing this from reaching the heights that were well within reach here. Maybe a better and more experienced director could have done more with it too, but putting all this aside, I still had great fun with it. It's one of those cases where it's almost impossible for this not to be enjoyable on at the very least a decent level because of who's in it. Helen Mirren's delight at being back in action (""This is all great fun!"") again coupled with her delightful burgeoning romance with Brian Cox dictates that much of what is best in the second half of Red surrounds her, and that's fine. Cox coming to her rescue after she's shot in the most gentlemanly way possible was one of those delightful movie moments that probably deserves to be in a more notable film. The action scenes are largely pretty exciting but could probably have done with a few more original moments such as Malkovich playing grenade baseball. It's an interesting departure from the geriaction genre and more enjoyable than pretty much all those films for taking a more lighthearted approach, and solid enough without ever really catching fire.",6,7,0,469,"10,151",26-Sep-17,rated-7

Mirren is utterly fantastic and puts Cox and Freeman in the shade. Urban plays the role a little too tight and doesn't seem to be able to have any fun.

It’s definitely not a great movie but it’s definitely not a horrible movie either. It was just a lot of fun. The action was great and it was just a really fun movie. It was also pretty funny at times. I think it would’ve been better if it was rated r but that is more of a nit pick. The main selling point here was the actors and actresses that were involved with the film. There were so many veteran actors/actresses. People that have been working in the business for such a long time. They made this film a lot better and more memorable. They were the main part in my enjoyment of the film. I’m surprised that they were able to get so many amazing performers for this film. You could also tell that they all had a fun time making it. They didn’t just seem to be there for a simple pay check.  The performances from pretty much everyone in the cast were great. Bruce Willis was pretty good in the movie. He hasn’t been in the best movies lately but this was pretty good. He also seems to not want to be there in a lot of the movies he’s in. He actually seemed like he wanted to be in this film. He was really good and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman was also really good here as he usually is. I do wish that he was in it more but when he was in it he was great. John Malkovich was possibly the stand out. He was pretty insane in the film. He was also hilarious at times. Helen Mirren was also pretty good in the movie. She was another great addition to the ensemble cast. Brian Cox was also really good in the movie and I didn’t expect him to be in it so it was a pleasant surprise. Karl Urban also gave a good performance in the movie. He was the antagonist. He was pretty cool in the film and I liked his character arc. He had more development to him than I thought he would get. Mary-Louise Parker was also good and she had a great relationship with Bruce Willis. I didn’t even name every actor in it because there were so many. This had a giant ensemble cast that definitely made the film more enjoyable. Everyone gave great performances in the movie. I did really like the action in the movie. There were some really fun action sequences throughout the film. They were well filmed and were really entertaining. The comedy was also pretty good. It wasn’t that funny but there were some hilarious moments. It isn’t a perfect movie and had quite a few problems but it was a lot of fun. I was never bored by it and it was basically entertaining from beginning to end. The ending was really nice and satisfying. The final shot was absolutely hilarious and this was just an enjoyable film.  The plot was pretty cliche and generic. It wasn’t anything very special. The plot was also a little convoluted at times especially near the end. The twists were good but kind of predictable. The ending was definitely predictable. You basically knew what was going to happen. It wasn’t a film that had anything mind blowing. I was able predict mostly what was going to happen. That doesn’t mean it’s not a fun movie. It’s just not very original or fresh. It’s not different from your average spy action comedy. I’d definitely recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service instead of this. Again it’s still a fun film just not a great movie.  If you want a fun action comedy that’s a little silly and stupid than you should watch this. It’s nothing horrible but nothing great either. If it weren’t for the cast, this film wouldn’t be as good or memorable.

To the point that when it's successful, I end up kind of shocked.  So it's weird how much I really liked the silly, cartoonish action while the jokes here ended up too awkwardly paced for me.  Not to say I didn't laugh quite a bit.  John Malkovich especially is funny, and the nonchalant way which these retired assassins approach death and destruction has enough legs as a concept to carry this through.  But, there's just something about the editing that undermines the comedic timing and overall chemistry of the characters.

Some of the faults can be attributed to the fact that it's purposefully stupid, but there's still a lot of wasted potential here.  The obvious draws of RED are its star-studded cast and strange premise: Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren star as retired special forces operatives on the run from their former employers. Sadly, the lackluster execution makes everything look uninspired and forgettable. My main issue with the movie is the character development, or lack thereof. For the most part, the source material doesn't translate well on screen. The character interactions feel fake more often than not, and the story itself is both forced and convoluted. On the bright side, the cast, though criminally underused, actually does a pretty good job. It probably helps that most of them are supposed to play bored and indifferent retirees, so you can't tell if they're half-assing it or not. Mary-Louise Parker was the real standout here, proving her comic chops as a supporting comedic relief character. With all that said though, I have to say that the movie is something of a guilty pleasure of mine, mostly because of Bruce Willis playing an older John McClane, and John Malkovich...well, being John Malkovich. Ultimately, RED may be an interesting concept for a comic book, but its adaptation is poorly thought out and little more than a forgettable action flick. I wouldn't particularly recommend it to anyone but die-hard fans of Bruce Willis.",6,4,0,98,105,29-Apr-16,rated-6

I do like Willis, Freeman and Malkovich so RED still ended up on my watchlist but it never had a high priority for me. Probably wouldn't have watched for another few years if it weren't for a friend who wanted to watch both RED movies with me. RED definitely tries to get an old school action movie kind of feel going. I think setting the story around christmas time was also intentional to get some Die Hard feelings going.The action was very extravagant to the point that it was pretty nonsensical. There is so much stuff that just happens out in the open without anyone noticing that you just have to accept that this movie isn't even trying to be realistic to enjoy this film.1 or 2 scenes are also overstylized but since it doesn't happen that often I can live with it.The romance between Brian Cox' and Helen Mirren's characters was pretty charming though.

False. Well, there are a couple of exceptions: - Helen Mirren firing a machine gun bigger than her while wearing a white dress and still looking fine.- John Malkovich, simply because he is John Malkovich. Everything he does is fucking awesome. In this case, he plays a delusional old man that was subject for 11 years to heavy LSD doses for governmental purposes. I approve enthusiastically. The film's biggest flaw is that it never determined whether if it wanted to be a comedic action/thriller or a DC adaptation, so it attempted to be both intermittently, ending up being a seriously uneven and uninteresting film. The ending ranks as one of the most ridiculous and unfunny of the decade. 51/100",4,37,4,209,"7,821",19-Aug-13,rated-5

It was however a very entertaining action/comedy that reignited Willis's career and also gave John Malkovich the chance to show what a versatile comedic actor he was. Stealing the limelight from Willis, Freeman, Dreyfuss, and a terrific Helen Mirren, Malkovich got all the best lines and most of the laughs here. Mary-Louise Parker also showed her value as a supporting player for an old-fashioned caper film full of action and wisecracks from the old stagers who all seem to be having the time of their lives. Karl Urban proves there's life after LOTR with another fine turn as a CIA agent caught up in a conspiracy involving the Retired Extremely Dangerous agents of the title.

The movie coasts on the charm of seeing Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren running around shooting guns and kicking butt (I'm also a huge fan of Karl Urban so its always good to see him in stuff).  The problem is that the movie never carves out an identity for itself. The movie starts off with a playful and humorous tone but the further you go along, the more generic it becomes. Likewise, the film starts with a sharp visual style (it almost felt like a Guy Ritchie film) but that fades away by the end too. The plot and attempts at character development are bland at best. But this is still a fun ""turn off your brain"" film that is at its best when characters just let loose and have fun with it and there are some really fun moments to be had. 2010",3,4,0,75,99,10-Sep-20,rated-6

It’s definitely not a great movie but it’s definitely not a horrible movie either. It was just a lot of fun. The action was great and it was just a really fun movie. It was also pretty funny at times. I think it would’ve been better if it was rated r but that is more of a nit pick. The main selling point here was the actors and actresses that were involved with the film. There were so many veteran actors/actresses. People that have been working in the business for such a long time. They made this film a lot better and more memorable. They were the main part in my enjoyment of the film. I’m surprised that they were able to get so many amazing performers for this film. You could also tell that they all had a fun time making it. They didn’t just seem to be there for a simple pay check.  The performances from pretty much everyone in the cast were great. Bruce Willis was pretty good in the movie. He hasn’t been in the best movies lately but this was pretty good. He also seems to not want to be there in a lot of the movies he’s in. He actually seemed like he wanted to be in this film. He was really good and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast. Morgan Freeman was also really good here as he usually is. I do wish that he was in it more but when he was in it he was great. John Malkovich was possibly the stand out. He was pretty insane in the film. He was also hilarious at times. Helen Mirren was also pretty good in the movie. She was another great addition to the ensemble cast. Brian Cox was also really good in the movie and I didn’t expect him to be in it so it was a pleasant surprise. Karl Urban also gave a good performance in the movie. He was the antagonist. He was pretty cool in the film and I liked his character arc. He had more development to him than I thought he would get. Mary-Louise Parker was also good and she had a great relationship with Bruce Willis. I didn’t even name every actor in it because there were so many. This had a giant ensemble cast that definitely made the film more enjoyable. Everyone gave great performances in the movie. I did really like the action in the movie. There were some really fun action sequences throughout the film. They were well filmed and were really entertaining. The comedy was also pretty good. It wasn’t that funny but there were some hilarious moments. It isn’t a perfect movie and had quite a few problems but it was a lot of fun. I was never bored by it and it was basically entertaining from beginning to end. The ending was really nice and satisfying. The final shot was absolutely hilarious and this was just an enjoyable film.  The plot was pretty cliche and generic. It wasn’t anything very special. The plot was also a little convoluted at times especially near the end. The twists were good but kind of predictable. The ending was definitely predictable. You basically knew what was going to happen. It wasn’t a film that had anything mind blowing. I was able predict mostly what was going to happen. That doesn’t mean it’s not a fun movie. It’s just not very original or fresh. It’s not different from your average spy action comedy. I’d definitely recommend Kingsman: The Secret Service instead of this. Again it’s still a fun film just not a great movie.  If you want a fun action comedy that’s a little silly and stupid than you should watch this. It’s nothing horrible but nothing great either. If it weren’t for the cast, this film wouldn’t be as good or memorable. Overall Red is a fun but generic action/comedy. 🔙Come Together 🔜Cars♻️🔜Yi Yi🔜Inside Llewyn Davis🔜Miller’s Crossing ",6,23,3,623,582,30-Aug-20,rated-7

Then some thumb-sucker came along and tagged him RED: Retired, Extremely Dangerous.¨ Robert Schwentke (The Time Traveler`s Wife, and Flightplan) had the privilege of directing a talented cast including Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, Brian Cox, Karl Urban, and Richard Dreyfuss. A lot of big names for the latest adaptation of the DC Comic graphic novel written by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner. One would expect nothing could go wrong with a movie with such great star power, but I was disappointed with this lightly entertaining comedy slash action flick. Red suffers from a poorly adapted screenplay written by Jon and Erich Hoeber (the guys who brought us one of the worst films of 2009: Whiteout). The plot is really bad, and the actors do the best they can in order to save the film. There are some funny moments (but far too few) thanks to the talent from the entire cast that save the movie from falling into horrible territory. John Malkovich gives a very comedic and surprising performance, but unfortunately he doesn`t get enough screen time to save the movie. The rest of the cast give good performances, but they are far from memorable. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker (Weeds) is pretty decent, although nothing we haven't seen before. I really expected this movie would have a lot more funnier moments, but the screenplay failed to help out the great cast. Red could have been much better if the producers would have taken more time in finding better screenwriters. I just felt this movie was like an All-Star team without a good coach to help them win the championship. With a better plot, Red would have been a great and memorable movie. Bruce Willis is Frank Moses, a former CIA agent who is now retired and having a difficult time making the transition. The only thing that seems to keep him going is when he gets to speak over the phone with his government pension representative, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). Her life doesn`t seem all that exciting either, and she spends her days working and reading sexy spy novels. Sarah and Frank spend a lot of time on the phone discussing their boring and lonely lives without having ever met, but they seem to enjoy each other. Their daily routines will change all of a sudden when someone puts a hit on Frank and tries killing him. Frank might be old, but he`s still got game. He manages to elude the dozen of assassins that are sent to his home and decides to give Sarah a visit in Kansas City guessing she might be in danger as well. Frank will need some help in order to discover who is after him so he decides to get his old CIA team back together: Marvin Boggs (John Malkovich), Victoria (Helen Mirren), and Joe Matheson (Morgan Freeman). They are all more than happy to get back in action since they all seem to have difficulties adapting to their retiree lives. Together they begin delving into the past in search for clues, while at the same time they have to face the young CIA agent who is after them: William Cooper (Karl Urban). Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, and Julian McMahon also have smaller roles in the film. I really wished this movie would have been funnier considering the talented cast. Malkovich is by far the funniest one in the film; I`ve seen Willis in better roles; Freeman doesn't add anything to the story; Urban being one of the younger actors proved he has what it takes to stand next to these A-list actors; Louise-Parker was pretty funny in this movie, but she is way better in Weeds; and Helen Mirren always brings her A game to the table. I didn`t have a problem with the performances, but I just wished they would have done a better job with the plot and the screenplay. This is one of those movies that looks hilarious in the trailers, but then you discover it isn`t actually that funny when sitting through the 100 minute film. Red is not terrible. I actually had a decent time watching it, but it is just light entertainment I wouldn`t consider recommending it or watching it over again. The movie did give me a nostalgic feeling seeing how so many of these actors are actually close to their retirement, but they still have the talent if given the right script to work with. I am a huge Bruce Willis fan, but I have to admit John Malkovich stole each scene he was in. Richard Dreyfuss and Brian Cox both have small parts in this movie, but they are really funny in it as well. Seeing these brilliant actors working together is the highlight of the film, but they should have brought in some talented screenwriters as well.  estebueno10.blogspot.com/",5,8,0,214,"2,168",2/6/13,rated-5

Young Jamie Bell in his first film role absolutely carried all this. Had no idea he was a trained dancer and it really shows here. Especially at a young age, his talent was impressive, giving an engaging performance of a boy doing what he loves but going against societal norms in a working class town. Bell's great work makes me forgive the predictable story. Aside from that, the often bland direction and mediocre writing drag this down for me.

It was very good, just as expected. Jamie Bell is incredible as the title role and Julie Walters as his dance teacher is just as phenomenal. The only big issue I with the film is that I don't think the performances besides those two characters ever are able to reach those levels of excellence, which is a shame because none of the performances are terrible in the film. The highlights in the film for were definitely how easily the film was able to juggle these intense topics of gender roles, homophobia, transphobia, and even capitalism and classism. But in its run time it is able to do it all pretty damn well. And while the film has some really rough scenes to watch because of the subjects it deals with the ending scene is so satisfying and has a great performance from the father.

Billy Elliot is a coming-of-age film for me, about a boy who breaks gender boundaries, explore in deep meaning, what it feels to chase after that flame of passion, and the simple lesson about support and dedication. We all need support from others in our lives, because they are what keep the burning desire in our hearts to pursue our passion, and be the best we can be. I wish I had the same support from my family when it comes to pursuing my literary passion in writing. The film also tackles breaking gender boundaries, because we often always try to put certain activities and standards for each gender, and it's time we start stopping this mindset, and let's all believe that everything is for everyone, not just for men, not just for women, but for all who love it and wanna do it.",2,9,0,101,177,18-Sep-20,rated-10

Sound familiar? Well yeah, 'cos it's basically a bit like Kes. Only here they've substituted keeping a kestral for ballet dancing. Unlike Ken Loach's classic, Stephen Daldry's debut offers a more upbeat, positive approach which ultimately makes it a lesser film for me personally. Despite the backdrop of the 84 minter's strike and the authentic shoot on real working class northern streets, social realism takes a back seat for the feelgood sentiment. Daldry shamelessly tugs at the heart strings in a manner that will either succeed or appall, but he's helped immeasurably by strong playing from the likes of Julie Walters, Gary Lewis - especially affecting as Billy's father, Jamie Draven, the legendary Jean Heywood and, in his debut, Jamie Bell.",4,25,6,722,"3,038",1-Mar-14,rated-5

The story is a long-winded chess game (aren't they all?) where we're not 100% certain of who is playing against each other until we find the out who are the chess pieces. It doesn't take too long to work out, and when we do, it's a real mismatch in terms of character.  Marquise de Merteuil vs. Vicomte de Valmont. A battle of wits and brains and sexual prowess. The latter, played extremely well by a certain John Malkovich rises head and shoulders above every other cast member and as a result, creates a juxtaposition that ultimately hinders the film's overall consistent quality. He perfectly plays the snaky, deceitful, suave player with confidence and a panache that makes everything else seem so dull in comparison.  Which brings me to the next point, Malkovich is practically always present - so that's a big bonus for the film, as extended periods of the film without him would have been a drab affair (a common practise within the film) (and by that, I mean affair, they're all fucking each other).  Other talking points is the playful tone encapsulated by the period music, and exceedingly enchanting aesthetic of the film - that although is not quite  Barry Lyndon  level is still top notch.  Final verdict.  Dangerous Liaisons  is a decent enough historical drama with a solid foundation and two interesting characters, albeit only one truly stands out due to the performance of Malkovich. The playful attitude of the film occasionally hinders the serious nature of some of the actions - perhaps similar to how HBO's Game of Thrones does often. The film starts off relatively well and fluctuates in quality until at various points characters start acting oddly and unnaturally, which at this point, its otherwise decent screenplay really suffers.",7,8,0,351,"1,589",21-May-14,rated-6

Glenn Close's Marquise, however? It is most difficult of all for a woman who has lost her innocence and her hope to live in a world such as this one. Patriarchy offers women nothing but coldness and thin fantasy. For a woman to survive in such a world is always overwhelmingly painful, and yet somehow so many of us do. Keanu is an angel sent down from heaven in this, and I wished he was in it more. It really is Merteuil's story in my mind, and whether or not de Laclos meant for us to sympathize with her (I haven't read the book, but as it was written in 18th century France, I'm gonna go with no), I did, fiercely. Every moment Close is given she makes the most of, drawing us in like a hard-wrought spell. Malkovich seems intent to steal the show, but even though the camera devotes itself most often to him, it's Close who held me under her thrall. I felt for her acutely. I felt relief for her, in the end; her mask finally falling, achingly painful, and yet also cathartic, like airing out a long-festered wound.",2,9,0,37,"1,086",8-Nov-18,rated-6

Slower, blander and consistently emptier, Dangerous Liaisons is in virtually all accounts a lesser experience when compared to its estranged cousin, Milos Forman's Valmont. Based on a play that itself was based on the novel of the same name, the film's depiction of aristocracy is filled with eye candy but forgets to input the same type of intrigue build-up that made Forman's film so enticing to watch. If there's any relevant plus points to talk about, they all begin and end with John Malkovich. It's strange that the choice to keep the original name of the novel was made for this film since most of the screentime is spent focusing on this character while Forman's film kept things more even and still went with the name change to name of this specific character. By not just taking the role of Sébastien de Valmont but also owning it, Malkovich makes the best out of a drab screenplay by playing the part of a devious little lecher perfectly, a performance he maintains stabilized throughout the whole picture. This still acts as a double-edged knife, however, as the magnetizing presence of Malkovich renders all other characters and storylines (even more) mundane. All the faults lie with the script, the big meanie that hinders the whole thing from the get go. The fact that is an adaptation of a theatrical production would be irrelevant if the author had the presence of mind to take advantage of the new medium the story is to be inserted while keeping the regal posture of the theater in for the sake of dialogue and performance quality. Instead, the leash of theatrical production is kept on tight by locking the characters in rooms again and again while a window is open to the promise of the sunny outdoors we rarely get to see. Soulless is really the word to describe the whole production and I'm not the just referring to the nature of the characters. There is a large amount of attention devoted to how the text sounds but not nearly as much to what it actually says. The story is rendered almost pointless by the constant back-and-forth between characters that adds little to overall scheme of things other than to establish that, yes, some of these people are very, very bad and other are mere pawns in their chess board. The problem is that only very rarely does someone bother to move the pieces.",5,16,7,286,556,9-May-14,rated-4

Glenn Close is outstanding in this—stringing everyone along, flirting outrageously, relishing every single moment—and Malkovich milks his role for all it’s worth. Enough enjoyment is sustained merely from watching him dart between rooms as he weaves his various schemes. The rest of the casting isn’t quite so inspired. Thurman as the ingénue doesn’t wholly add up for me, and there’s nothing more ridiculous than the sight of a dewy-eyed Keanu in his silly wig and all of that flamboyant period finery.

Back at university, while studying for my undergraduate degree in education, I completed a course called ""Multi-arts and the Curriculum"". One of the assignments was to select a great piece of cinema and to critique it. I can't remember it being any more specific than that. Stepping over Casablanca, The Third Man and Citizen Kane, this is the film I chose. It is a decision my lecturer found puzzling, to say the least. Unfortunately, scrounging around under my mother's house for an hour didn't turn up the assignment (though I did find some of my very impressive technical drawings from high school and a wad of papers from my post-graduate linguistics degree, which are far too intelligent for me to make any sense of now).  So, instead of transcribing that paper word for word, you are going to get the updated version, based on this recent revisit, in which I attempt to dredge up my thinking at the time and justify my insupportable stance that Stephen Frear's Dangerous Liaisons is a cinematic masterpiece. Don't get me wrong. I love the film (obviously, it is here on this list) but I'd hesitate to label it cinematic. Frears' direction is a little too prosaic for that and Christopher Hampton's screenplay, while it is easily one of Dangerous Liaison's most remarkable achievements (the fact that I quote it throughout is testament to its lasting charms), cannot shake the marks of adaptation. In fact, if we choose to view Frears' film of an adaptation of Hampton's screenplay, which he adapted from his own play, which was in turn adapted from Pierre Choderlos de Laclos' novel 'Les Liaisons dangereuses', the film is three times removed from its source. And that is only if we consider the epistolary novel the source; there's another step back if we consider the imagined act of the protagonists writing their letters...

Just ask the Marquise De Merteuil (Glenn Close) and the Vicomte De Valmont (John Malkovich). Stephen Frears' ""Dangerous Liaisons"" is extraordinary. It's almost surprising to find, in amongst these glorious settings, with stunning gardens and ravishing costumes, so much unpleasantness, viciousness, nastiness and cruelty.  Christopher Hampton's adapted screenplay is astonishing, with it's impressive, beautifully constructed dialogue, where the scheming, plotting and intended endgames are carefully just lurking beneath what is actually being said, as Close, a widow and ""a virtuoso of deceit"" schemes with the rampantly sexually active and former lover Malkovich, to make another ex lover of hers a laughing stock by deflowering his intended wife - and ""guaranteed virtue"" - Cecile De Valanges (Uma Thurman). In return, he will be rewarded with one final night of passion with Close.  He agrees to this ""easy"" challenge, but Malkovich also has his own game in mind - seducing Madame De Tourvel (Michelle Pfeiffer), married and famous for her dedication to the sanctity of marriage. This, he is certain, will be his ultimate sexual victory and the most prestigious, crowning glory to the reputation he has already spent his life proudly earning. We've got a right couple of bastards here folks.  What follows soon escalates into downright cruelty, as the seduction of both Thurman and Pfeiffer escalates from relatively simple stakes into situations with truly devastating consequences, as love makes an unexpected and unwelcome appearance, bringing with it confusion, denial, jealousy, devastation and violence. This beats Milos Forman's misjudged, strangely playful, childlike mischievous version of the same story ""Valmont"" hands down and Close seriously knocks it out of the park here as she plays her favourite game (fucking with people), only to find herself becoming unexpectedly and disconcertingly out of her depth. Glorious in every aspect, ravishing to behold and increasingly uncomfortable and upsetting as it unfolds, this has to be seen. And with a closing shot - so masterful, that whenever I see it, I have to remind myself to breathe...",8,15,7,508,508,18-Dec-19,rated-10

If I didn't know Frears was an Englishman I would have guessed after about ten minutes of this film, such is the obviously English nature of his staging of the period drama aspects. It's all very BBC.  On the plus side you've got little Johnny Malkovich who is a far superior Valmont, even though Phillipe must have studied this film intensely before turning up to his first day of shooting Cruel Intentions. Michelle Pfeiffer inhabits her role almost completely, a feat I would never have expected from a young American actor of almost any generation, and almost certainly I'd be pushed to name a modern American actor who could do as good a job without that knowing 21st century look on their face at all times. She's so good that I might even be persuaded to give Scorsese's take on Edith Wharton a shot, even though he cast the female Keanu Reeves as if in competition with Frears for who could make the most ludicrous casting choice for a period drama. Glenn Close got nominated for an Oscar, and she is good here, but I'm finding it hard to admit that Sarah Michelle Gellar gave a much stronger performance in the same role. Perhaps Gella had to carry more of the film and sell her reactions better in a much flimsier screenplay but I found her psychologically conflicted Merteuil a much more interesting character to Close's purely manipulative one.  But the major flaws found in Cruel Intentions are still there in Dangerous Liaisons, Kumble's adaptation must surely have been from this film rather than the source novel? I shall have to watch Milos Forman's Valmont soon to be certain, but there is still a chance that the plot holes and inexplicable silliness of the characters come from the scandalous 18th Century novel.",4,5,2,83,765,25-Apr-16,rated-7

It both luxuriates in the irresistible devilishness of Merteuil and Valmont, and shows how their superficiality actually has consequences - because everyone, even themselves, can’t help but have emotions. And this understanding of both the attractive and the moral power of appearances is echoed throughout in the film’s glorious and dark cinematography, and in the costumes which are at once magnificent and clearly very constraining.  Malkovich’s performance is truly unique; when Valmont talks to Tourvel in his romantic language, Malkovich adopts a semi-ironic tone that give his performance double the depth. Because as it turns out, even this hyper romantic talk was, in fact, honest: Valmont eventually realises that he did mean every one of these words. It was his superficiality and his inability to imagine in himself any kind of profundity that made him believe these words of love had to be just smoke and mirrors.  This is a film (and a book) all about language, how we use it to hide behind it or to reveal ourselves through it - how we often paint images with words, but these images still always say something about ourselves.",3,16,0,161,"3,018",5-Apr-20,rated-10

It’s a scathing commentary on the wealthy and bored class, who use people as playthings and view genuine feelings as a contemptible vice of the naive and pitied. Though the story can drag at times, there are numerous powerful and poignant moments. And that last scene with Glenn Close, that quiet and searing closeup of her face as she confronts the results of her actions—I’m astonished at the complexity and magnitude of emotions, the sheer volume of information that can be relayed by this seemingly simple shot. This is a truly masterpiece of acting, as a soul is laid bare right in front of our eyes. Wordless, searching, grieving—brilliance. A moment like this is so rare and human and beautiful. Sadness, regret, and struggling acceptance of the destruction left behind and the terrible road ahead.

Period dramas can be dull affairs but not when the material is as scandalous and debauched as this. Frears throws period accuracy out the window, instead opting for an unconventional, mostly American cast of actors in roles usually populated by Brits with plums in their mouths. John Malkovich is a force of nature, bringing his usual shouty confidence and intensity, whilst Glenn Close is every bit his match as the conniving Marquise De Merteuil. Some young faces make early appearances too, Uma Thurman and a rather miscast Keanu Reeves are interesting choices and Michelle Pfeiffer plays the most endearing character with immense pathos and warmth. The sets are exquisite, tragedy, impropriety and comedy are interwoven masterfully but it lacks any emotional heft.

She introduced it to me nearly twenty years ago on an old VHS tape that didn't do justice to the sheer pageantry on show from both the actors and the stunning costume designs from James Acheson who won a well deserved Academy Award for his efforts. It's a film that shimmers from the opening moments, and has remarkable performances from Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer, early promise from Uma Thurman, a career-best from John Malkovich, and unfortunately a real bummer from young Keanu. Pierre Choderlos De Laclos' novel has never had a better adaptation to the screen, although Milos Forman did bring another version of this tale just a year after Frears' film hit the cinemas, which was a financial disaster.  This film however will be remembered for some of the shenanigans off-screen that became almost as big a talking point as the film itself. An affair between Malkovich and Pfeiffer effectively ended Malkovich's marriage to Glenne Headly, and the chemistry onscreen between them is sensational to watch, only adding that extra bit of spice to a tale that has more than enough already. Frears' best film in my humble opinion, this should have cleaned up at the Academy Awards. Close and Pfeiffer both got nominations and both got robbed, although not as badly as Sigourney who was nominated in both categories, and Malkovich was ignored entirely, something that simply astounds me. A film that I've eventually tracked down on Blu-Ray, this looks and sounds fabulous, and as the years go by this film means so much more to my wife and I as one of those films she introduced me to that we both still love. She knows the whole script, as do I, but that sparkle this brings to her eyes never fails to make me realise how lucky I am.",2,32,2,332,"3,882",4-Mar-20,rated-10

There are quite a lot of polite rubes in the cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman are crucial cast mates – it is a treat to see both of them young and beautiful with porcelain skin and delicately braided hair, the two of them both embodying acute virtue, before that is corrupted. Here are a group of actors, yes these four specifically, who get under the skin and find the ticking heartbeat of nobles living within 18th century France luxury. It all depends of where you are on the societal totem pole, but virtue and upholding chastity seems to be an essential for most women. While a man in past centuries is free to be sexually polymorphous to a degree, a woman who surrenders herself to the wrong man and deserted is subsequently maligned in the court of public opinion, thus, ruined easily. That’s why the chaste virginity is so cautiously protected by any countess. However, when it is a married woman who is caught in infidelity, it may not only merely smear her reputation but her cuckold husband, too. I hadn’t seen Dangerous Liaisons for a very long time, and had early doubts. I felt the early sections didn’t show off the glamorous locales and sets very well; I feared I was in store for some dull revenge games between scamps and fools. For some reason I thought director Stephen Frears (“My Beautiful Laundrette”) was doing it all too politely and workmanlike. But, in time, the film gathers some bite and flaunts its decadence.  Marquise de Merteuil (Close) would like to smear a particular pretty and gullible woman’s reputation by enlisting former lover Valmont (Malkovich) to seduce and destroy. Yes, I confess that I am confused as to whom he is to seduce for several long minutes on end because of the cluster of supporting characters. But once the film develops long enough and I’ve sorted through all the character motivations, and we get the nastiness, the covert hostility, the vitriol, the venom, and all that dangerousness festers in, I’m all hooked. Dangerous Liaisons eventually quivers and throbs with intrigue, and the great acting clicks into place. Center stage is Malkovich, whose smarm is something you have to call vintage enfant terrible Malkovich.  Like “Barry Lyndon” (1975) or “The Duellists” (1978), Dangerous Liaisons goes beyond the cruelty of dueling wits and leads to a final fencing duel, fancily staged by Frears, so men can protect their pride. What is preceded was a shot of a delicate woman we have come to love, now succumbed to sickness in bed, prompted by a broken heart that binds her whole physical well-being. Even more impressive are the final shots of Merteuil at the opera, whom has found a way not to draw envy from her contemporaries, but derision. The look of dishonor on one’s face has never been so ostensibly captured as it is by Glenn Close.

A man with a reputation as a ""swordsman"", he is infamous among the Parisian high society with his lustful indiscretions. Rich,powerful and above all unscrupulous in his dealings with the opposite sex he has attracted  his fair share of enemies. Suave and arrogant, morality takes second place to his lust and deceitfulness. A serious player, he is about to be dragged into a deadly game with tragic consequences.Vicomte's former lover, the manipulative Marquise de Merteuil,played to perfection by Glenn Close, sets him a challenge to ruin another of her former lover's upcoming nuptials. A bet involving the deflowering of a certain Uma Thurman in all her youthful glory is deliciously wicked and conjures up some really comical scenes as well as drama. Vicomte's own challenge to himself is the seduction of the virtuous Madame de Tourvel, a pristine woman of impeccable character who he woos relentlessly. Michelle Pfeiffer dons the corsets to play the quiet but beautiful Madame and although virginal can't quite say no to Malkovich's advances.A perverse and compelling story is played out with more twists and turns than a Shakespearean tragedy. The main performers all excel and with the exception of a wooden Keanu Reeves doing another of those silly voices of his, contribute to a film that fully justified it's seven Oscar Nominations although how Malkovich missed out is beyond me. Vicious, satirical and wickedly funny in parts, this was the first real costume drama that hooked me. Close's character is just so horrible, she could put you off women forever, but her appeal is tantalizingly provocative. Frears would go on to make some cracking films over the years but this along with ""High Fidelity"" are the ones that stand out in an award filled career. A movie that looks as good as it sounds, Philippe Rousselot's cinematography is impeccable and adds depth to a stunning piece of cinema.",1,9,9,332,"3,882",3-Aug-13,rated-10

Both the book and the film succeeded in making those crazy people look somewhat logical in their decisions, yet I thought they remained largely fantastical.  Rewatching it today, a few years into adulthood and a few disappointments and disillusions behind me (lol I'm still a baby tho), the manipulations of trust and the lengths to which Valmont and Merteuil go to reach their lustful and selfish, pointless goals, seem somewhat less fanciful, and even more wicked.  Even more saddening for me is to realise so fully that Tourvel's blindness to Valmont's tricks is utterly believable, and realistic. She is no stupid woman. She doesn't give in easily, and she means everything she says or does. Yet she cannot avoid his manipulations. It's the kind of film that confirms my theory that growing up is a process of degeneration, where all the simple ideas -all coming down to the easy delineation between what is bad and what is good- that we relied upon to move through life until our 20s or so, start crumbling down, and we then spend the rest of our lives trying to rebuild them up, if not into their original shape (it's probably impossible), then into a new one that fits into our complicated morals and definitions of ourselves.",4,62,3,161,"3,018",15-Nov-16,rated-9

For a movie seemingly catered to all of my interests I was shocked by how bored I was for most of it. I was lost in the intricacies of who was being courted and for what reason. Maybe I was tired or distracted. I really wish I liked this more, though the last 15 minutes is quite satisfying even though I was a bit lost as to how we got there.  What I do appreciate, at least according to my read on this film, is how a life of complete and utter freedom takes its toll. A life where anything is available to you can often mean you have nothing. It leads to self-indulgence and deceit all for a hint of feeling. That the Marquise and the Vicomte all got their own personal cumuppance in the most dramatic of ways is a rightful criticism of their excesses and the measures to which they go to find feeling amidst the numbness.

Nothing, and I mean nothing says authentically French like a cast composed of: Glenn Close, John Malkovich, Michelle Pfieffer, Uma Thurman and maybe the most decadently French of them all, Keanu Reeves.  A barrage of  odd choices to be sure, but if you can get over this glaring flaw, if you even want to call it that, Dangerous Liaisons  is a wildly entertaining and debaucherous  tale of deceit, manipulation and all around cantankerous douchebaggery. That being said, for the purposes of this story adapted from a novel of the time period, the casting decisions are actually spot on.  One doesn’t exactly first think of Malkovich as an irresistible womanizer but he pulls it off here as he is comfortably operating within his wheelhouse playing the ultimate weasel, a role he has repeatedly perfected.  Glenn Close is comparably suited in her role as his female counterpart, playing a character that could only be described as ‘a heartless, icy bitch.’  Together they are the puppet masters pulling all of the strings while playing their games of sadistic instigation.   A young Uma Thurman plays the drop dead gorgeous, naïve and impressionable pawn in their game and then there is Pfeiffer, the moralistically pure innocent target of their wrath.  But lest ye forget  Keanu Reeves.  Much like in his appearances in the period films, Bram Stoker’s Dracula  and Much Ado About Nothing , you really have to wonder how the hell he wormed his way onto these sets.  I’ve always assumed they probably had to repeat numerous takes in these films from Keanu accidentally slipping ‘dude’ into his dialogue.   But like those films, he is not enough to ruin the fun and you forgive them the fact, dismissing it as someone getting their wish in getting to dress the pretty little son of a bitch up like a doll.   It is my opinion that Dangerous Liaisons should be forgiven its indiscretions and lack of period authenticity, because it is an intriguing and effective story carried out by some proper American actors.  Even if you usually steer clear of the stuffy, romantic chamber dramas of which there have been so many, do not be deterred, this is not those films.  Rather this is Pride & Prejudice, but only if all of those characters also happened to be sociopaths.   It’s a good ‘un!",4,12,2,381,"1,543",9-Nov-16,rated-8

Parfumes, make up, eye catching clothes that bring out attention on feminine/masculine attributes, the superficiality is on full display. The movie doesn't care for authenticity of the period, but there is still a significance of the setting: 1780's France. No wonder the populace was so eager to see heads flying from guillotines once the revolution started, when the aristocracy only wore masks of enlightenment and decency, underneath was a rotten core that played with human lives like they were exploited dolls. And for what reason, a question my arise? Just for sickly fun. Glenn Close and John Malkovich were never better, a decadent duo that radiates elegancy and vicious cynicism in equal manner while emotionally toying with young Uma Thurman and Keanu Reeves and the devastatingly naive Michael Phifer. While the concluding fall favors one, giving the rapist character a last minute shine of decency, the final image resonates long after the credits, as cruelty, debauchery, and false beauty are exposed with one make up removing hand.",1,7,0,152,244,20-Oct-19,rated-8

Just like in Snakes on a Plane, the title of this film sums up perfectly what this movie is all about. Sure, there are no correlation between those movies other than that, and the fact that both being cheesy, badly written horror flicks, it was just a thought that popped into my head as I watched it. It's pretty obvious that all the boys DO love Mandy Lane, even to the point where they are willing to throw themselves head first off roofs to get her attention... This is not a good film, and even though Amber Heard is a damn good-looking woman it didn't make up for the lousy writing, the cringeworthy awkwardness, deliberate or not, the poor attempts at ""artsy"" cinematography and the fact that for nearly 2/3 of the movie it's incredibly boring. It's not like this is one of the worst films I've ever seen, it's just so dull, and it takes itself so seriously. It's been 8 years since its release, and people still watch it, so it seems like one of those flicks that could get itself a little cult status going for it, as I'm sure there are some guys out there who need a daily dose or two of the leading actress, if you know what I mean. But the problem is of course that it's not like this is a film that's so awful it's good either. It just is a bang average horror/slasher type film, with only a little bit of entertainment value going for it.

Diesem eingerosteten Konstrukt versucht er mit dem Mysterium um seine Hauptfigur und hippen Kameraspielchen einen frischen Anstrich zu verpassen. Nach holprigem Einstieg gelingt das auch ganz gut und wenn die obligatorische Teenie-Truppe dann in ihre Party in einem einsamen Farmhaus abzieht, unterhält das durchaus und die Vorfreude auf das blutige Treiben steigt. Letzteres folgt dann natürlich auch, kommt leider aber nie richtig in Fahrt. Denn immer wieder entschleunigt sich der Film selbst mit nervigen Sperenzchen zwischen den Kills. Der Film verkommt so aber auch nicht zur reinen Schlachtplatte, sondern versucht bedacht auf sein Finale hinzuarbeiten, dass durchaus überzeugen kann. Dennoch hätte diesem mehr Futter im Vorfeld gutgetan, denn Motivationen und Hintergründe werden sehr vage gehalten.

While I am thankful after the twist was finally revealed that the filmmakers did not give us a long, drawn out explanation as to why Mandy is a manipulative, sociopathic killer I was hoping for a better ending. It would have been fantastic if Garth would have sat up and killed her, then collapse and die himself.  Thankfully I am not a boy because I would be offended that I am lumped up with everyone else in reference to loving this character, because unfortunately I didn't even like her.  Through the entire movie we are hit over the head with the fact these horny boys lust after her, the girls are seeking her approval, even the ranch-hand thinks she's ""different"" but she barely has any lines! I'm sorry but I can not judge a character on how much I like them based on superficial qualities unless the character is played by James Spader. To me, Mandy looks like every other generic ""hot"" girl in a film made after 1998. In the 1980s whenever a slasher film decided to throw a ""killer girl"" wrench into the formulaic gears, she had a personality.   The film was depending too much on outward appearance, not just of the actors/characters but [the original] Texas Chainsaw Massacre-inspired, overly sunny, natural cinematography.

Despite the awful characters, jarring camerawork and unrealistic depiction of teenagers, there’s a few redeemable features in here - just not enough to make the rest of the film work.  The story follows Mandy Lane, Amber Heard, who is pretty much the most popular girl at school. All the boys want to be with her and all the girls want to be her friend. After joining some of her schoolmates at one of their ranches, they begin to get killed off by Mandy’s best friend, who at first seems to be acting alone. The film goes from there and chucks in a last-minute twist that was the cherry on top of an already far-fetched film filled with questionable to downright stupid decisions. Also, if you’re going to stick a character’s name in the title, at least go about developing them and making them more interesting to watch - Heard’s performance is practically emotionless and there’s not much to her as a protagonist.  The rest of the cast throw in some equally boring/cliche performances as the typical set of victims you see in these films. They’re pretty much all one-note stereotypes and not a single one of them was a likeable character. Slasher films are no stranger to over-sexualisation and can usually get away with a loose plot or a few discrepancies here and there. It was just too much for me here though and it felt pretty tasteless. All the guys are sleazy, sex-obsessed morons and the two other girls are mean, vindictive assholes and to top it off they’re constantly drinking or doing drugs. I sort of knew what I was in for at the start after the guy jumps from the roof so I was at least able to prepare myself.  The camerawork is very messy and uncentered which, along with the gritty sort of hue the film’s seen through, reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre at points, but it didn’t suit the rest of the films tone in my opinion. The editing can be very choppy at some points but it occasionally works - mostly in scenes where theres music playing which leads me to what I thought was the best part of the film - the soundtrack. Some of the scenes with just music were strangely dreamy and calming, it reminded me a little of The Virgin Suicides.  The kills in the film were pretty messed up but it takes a fair bit to get to them. Plus, the person doing most of the killing is a whiny, obsessive douche-bag so it took away from the extremity of what I was seeing.  All in all, while the films still watchable, there’s hundreds of slashers I would watch over this and I doubt I’ll be revisiting it anytime soon. I can see why a lot of people are fans though - it’s unapologetic about what it is and there’s a decent enough premise there for a slasher.",6,21,5,"4,508","2,395",9-May-20,rated-3

But bearing all that in mind, this ain't a bad little movie. As per the title, Mandy Lane is good-looking and popular, but to everyone's frustration she's a ""good girl"", never overdoing the drink, avoiding the drugs, eschewing skinny-dips, and apparently still a virgin. (*whisper it*: actually she's quite boring and lacking in charisma.) She and five friends head to the countryside for a weekend of partying, and one by one they're violently killed off... whoever could be to blame? I'm not hugely keen on slashers where the victims ""deserve"" to die, because how are you meant to fear their fates? You certainly can't root for the rapey boys and bitchy girls you get here.

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane felt exactly like this, except I actually did see the entire film.  The movie seems lazy yet rushed in regards to storyline with little buildup. The movie starts with all the guys gawking at the title character Mandy Lane. “Mandy Lane got hot over summer”, one teen who isn’t a day under 40 says as he pops his head out of the car. And that’s our character development and story. Mandy and her best friend Emmett were nerds and possibly picked on by the popular crowd? How were they picked on and what was the extent? Who knows the movie doesn’t waste time on this—but it will state repeatedly how hot and chaste Mandy is. The movie is your average (or in this case, far below average) teen slasher film.  The teens are picked off one by one… I guess because they’re bullies, thus being horrible people worthy of being slaughtered?  The movie is supposed to be a revenge movie, but besides one mean jock, the revenge just felt so meaningless – There could have been better ways to convey this, for example, in the movie Carrie, we were shown the torturous bullying that lead to her breakdown, and ultimately being the catalyst to her mass murdering her peers. Here it looks as if someone haphazardly wrote the script and didn’t want to put time nor effort into plot or character development and figured scattering a few lines of dialogue would give the audience all the back-story needed to advance the story; more thought seemed to go into producing an incredibly unbelievable “gotcha” twist of an ending.

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane präsentiert sich als konventioneller Slasher mit Genre-Klischee-Galore, überrascht lediglich dadurch, dass er keinen Hehl darum macht, die Identität des zu verbergen. Nur die Motivationen bleiben im Verborgenen.  Bevor es aber zum endenden Twist kommt, werden zahlreiche misogyne Sprüche abgelassen, Alkohol und Drogen konsumiert und Protagonistin Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) angegafft. Die ist nämlich die begehrteste Frau der Schule. Die Joker-Karte. Der ""Pokal"" für die gierende Männlichkeit. Warum genau das so ist, kann der Film dabei aber gar nicht sagen. Denn ihr Charakter bleibt unscheinbar, undurchsichtig und so richtig sympathisch ist sie auch nicht. Immer wieder betonen Dialoge der männlichen Protagonisten, wie besonders Mandy Lane ist. Doch gibt das Drehbuch nicht preis, was sie auf dieses Podest erhebt.  Und dann beginnt das Sterben. Die Truppe wird nach und nach dezimiert, wobei es einige fiese Momente gibt, besonders explizit oder ausufernd wird es aber nicht. Da man den Killer kennt, kann man sich auch gleich denken wer hier überleben wird, selbst ohne Exposition zur Motivation. Und auch den Twist selbst kann man dann bereits erahnen, auch wenn er von der Charakterzeichnung her nach wie vor keinen Sinn ergibt, da sämtliche Schlüsselfiguren viel zu blass bleiben.  Eine gewisse Spannung und die solide Inszenierung kann man dem Film dennoch nicht absprechen. Nur durch die vielen stumpfen Dialoge muss man sich durchbeißen, um Spaß damit haben zu können. Audiovisuell reißt Mandy Lane ebenfalls keine Bäume aus. Vor allem in den Außenaufnahmen wird mit überbelichteten und schweißtreibenden Bildern versucht eine Texas Chainsaw-Stimmung aufkommen zu lassen. Das funktioniert bedingt und der Film wirkt dabei eher billig. Schauspielerisch zieht Amber Heard hier an jedem vorbei und das mag mit ihren wenigen Lines schon etwas heißen. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane übt eine seltsame Faszination aus. Weil er nicht viel von sich Preis gibt, schockierende Dinge einfach passieren lässt und man nie ganz weiß, ob man das gezeigte wirklich ernst nehmen soll. Am Ende sorgt dieser ungebundene Ansatz aber für den Bezugsverlust zu den Figuren, wenn es am Zuschauer liegt die Situation einzuordnen. Ein trübendes Finale, welches ein unbefriedigendes Gefühl nach einem mittelmäßigen Film zurück lässt. ----------------------------------------- Drooling boys, boiling hormones, a secluded house, dead teenagers. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane presents itself as a conventional slasher with genre cliché galore, surprising only in that it makes no bones about concealing the identity of the one. Only the motives remain hidden.  However, before the ending twist comes to an end, numerous misogynous sayings are made, alcohol and drugs are consumed and protagonist Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) is ogled. She is the most wanted woman at school. The Joker Card. The ""trophy"" for the greedy manhood. The movie can't tell us why this is the case, though. Her character remains inconspicuous, intransparent and she isn't really likeable, either. Over and over again the dialogues of the male protagonists emphasize how special Mandy Lane is. But the script doesn't reveal what she puts on this pedestal.  And then the dying begins. The troupe is decimated bit by bit, and there are some nasty moments, but it doesn't become especially explicit or overflowing. Since you know the killer, you might as well think about who will survive, even without exposure to motivation. And even the twist itself can already be guessed, even though it still doesn't make sense from a character drawing point of view, as all of the key characters remain far too pale.  Nevertheless, you can't deny the movie's tension and the solid production. Only because of the many dull dialogues you have to work your way through, in order to have fun with it. Audiovisually, Mandy Lane also doesn't tear up any trees. Especially in the outdoor shots there is an attempt to create a Texas Chainsaw atmosphere with overexposed and sweaty pictures. This works conditionally and the film looks rather cheap. Acting-wise Amber Heard passes everyone by and that may be quite something with her few lines. All the Boys Love Mandy Lane exerts a strange fascination. Because he doesn't give away much of himself, lets shocking things just happen and you never really know if you should take what he shows you really seriously. In the end, however, this unattached approach leads to a loss of reference to the characters, when it's up to the viewer to classify the situation. A gloomy finale, which leaves an unsatisfying feeling after a mediocre movie.",15,17,3,130,"3,852",12-Jul-20,rated-5

First up, I've read a lot of vitriol against it which seems to be based on weird personal hatreds people have for Amber Heard - I'd only say, just ignore that stuff. There is definitely something going on with Jonathan Levine's film worth paying attention to. I think the question here is how much actual substance lies under the style. Because style it has. The cinematography by Darren Genet is just incredible - a mix of hand-held immediacy and heat-hazed atmosphere. This teen-eye view of life feels so intense - it's like we're watching the action through a miasma of air-floating pheremones as everyone lusts after Mandy - and not just the boys. There is one sequence where one of the teens is chased by the killer in a car. The way this is shot - from a long distance over Mandy's shoulder, where you feel the dimensions of the space and it takes on almost documentary precision - I'm just sure I have never seen a shot quite like that before. It's so interestingly put together, this movie. As the film kicks into the second act, I did feel a bit deflated - like we were going somewhere interesting but ended up in the old cabin-in-the-woods slasher destination we've seen so many times before. And there is a third act twist which I wasn't down on per se, but which left me thinking ""Um, OK... but why???"" But this one has stayed with me. It didn't totally land for me, but I think Levine is saying something here about sexuality and objectification. I don't think he entirely succeeds, but I guess I'm from the camp that is engaged and still wants to understand it, as opposed to those who were annoyed by it and have dismissed it.",5,5,0,248,454,17-Aug-20,rated-7

The filming style and cinematography is ugly, employing a washed-out, high-contrast look that was popular in the mid-2000s to no doubt hide a lack of budget. The plot of the story is confusing by the end, and the ""twist"" is so utterly predictable almost an hour before it happens. Whilst the deaths of this horror film are gory, and sometimes fun - there's just not enough here to sustain, other than a few quirky moments. The film employs a gross male gaze to women, which adds to an icky feeling - without any notable reason why anyone would even like Mandy Lane, or any kind of understandable reasoning as to her position by the film's end.",3,9,0,"35,721","9,029",27-Jan-17,rated-4

It’s Mandy Lane (Amber Heard), the prettiest girl to ever walked the high school halls of Texas. Many boys have started to notice the once-invisible Mandy, who appears to have blossomed overnight into someone worth noticing and worth inviting to a party. So that’s what classmate Chloe (Whitney Able) does: invite Mandy to a party with a few friends at a country house upstate and a few of Mandy’s male admirers are also there and instantly start making attempts at wooing her. Many of them would die for a chance to be with the radiant Mandy but someone is out there and is willing to fulfill their wish but the ultimate catch is that they’re not going to be with Mandy, that’s for sure. The story of the behind-the-scenes turmoil involving the release of this film is as storied as the movie itself. First, the shut down. Senator Entertainment was set to release the film in theaters after acquiring it from The Weinstein Company but the company’s financial troubles and eventual shutdown led to a delay in release in the US for 7 years while the film was released in theaters in the UK in 2008. Then, The Weinstein Company re-acquired the film in 2013, giving the film a Video On Demand release in September and a limited theatrical release in October, through a joint contract between Senator and TWC division Radius-TWC, who’s better known for distributing Snowpiercer. The film itself is fine for what it is and the cinematography is surprisingly excellent for a movie like this but unfortunately it just ends up feeling all too similar to other similar thrillers and it can get redundant and tiresome. However, aside from the cinematography, Heard’s performance is what keeps the movie slightly interesting. You won’t love All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. You won’t like it as much. You’ll just admire it for what it is. Next up: ? (Not sure you’ll love it but find out next time if you do)",2,5,0,"1,503","1,280",8-Oct-18,rated-6

I was surprised to find that Amber Heard was the lead actress since she wasn't listed in the top of the cast list on Netflix instant.  If nobody has read any of my reviews of her films, they might not know that I would cut off a hand to even touch her.   Anyway, I kmow that this film has some mixed reviews, but I really liked it.  It looks fucking amazing.  I have read this before in other reviews, but I can't go without saying this film looks beautiful.  Then you are bombarded with a lot of notable songs that (I personally don't like very much), but I'm quite sure a lot of the budget was used on the rights to the music. For the most part I thought the performances were pretty good.  Nothing amazing, but for what the material was, I thought the actors were fine.  Others have said that the characters aren't very likable, and i would agree for all of them except Heard.  Ok, I'm biased, fuck off.  I was actually more disturbed by the fact that every guy in the film was actively trying to fuck Mandy Lane at the same time.  I don't know about most guys, but I'm not going to try to dip my wick 10 seconds after I watched my best friend do the same thing.  Oh and I knew that blond chick that shows her boobs looked familiar, she's the lead actress from Monsters.  And also if I just got a hummer from a girl in the barn, I would certainly try to take the job further, even if I'm trying to get in the pants of another girl in the house.  I don't think that's an accurate account of a high school kid. The story might not be very original, I guess it's no different than any other slasher from the last decade or so.  But for me, the amazing look of the film and my lover Amber helped in my enjoyment of the film.

It faces the same problem that this year's ""You're Next"" faced in that it's trashier than most slashers and has that ""indie"" feel to it that would make it hard to connect to modern day audiences.

This is a very, very bad film. It's a slasher but, ooh, Jonathan Levine doesn't want it to *seem* like a slasher. How ghastly, he must have thought! No, let's soup it up with some in-depth discussion about body image and sexual harassment and high school bullying because that's what I want to be fucking watching with my slasher film. Levine, who has eventually gone on to better things with the recent Long Shot, does a horrible job with this on all fronts. The twist and double twist are unbelievably obvious - why? Because I figured them out and I keep telling you that I'm an idiot. The opening half an hour of this is so utterly tedious, and the murders are uninspired and lacking in any flair. Levine also makes no effort to make anybody here even slightly likeable so why I should I give a shit if anybody survives? Amber Heard doesn't cover her character's intentions nearly as subtly as is necessary and at this juncture I'm fairly convinced I will never see another interesting performance from her.

Then, the film's distributor went bankrupt shortly after purchasing it, and it sat on the shelf for seven years.  In the meantime, Levine went on to make THE WACKNESS (which I've never seen but have always intended to), 50/50 (excellent), and WARM BODIES (meh).   In all those years on the shelf, it's always been on my mind.  In the beginning, its inaccessibility was tantalizing because the few reviews available hailed it as a new classic, a slasher deconstruction on a par with SCREAM.  Gradually, as more people saw it, its status started to drop as reviewers started being all ""eh, it's not all THAT great."" I don't agree with either camp completely, but I certainly would be in the former if pressed to choose sides.  ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE is no masterpiece and it's no SCREAM, but it's pretty damn good. Amber Heard plays the titular character, a somewhat odd teenage girl whose friendly aloofness and smoking-hot looks make her absolutely irresistible, understandably so, to all the boys in school with her.  Newly popular because of her blossoming looks, she's invited to a party at a remote ranch house, and soon after night falls, the bodies start dropping. The film is primarily interesting in how it combines characters and a story straight out of a run-of-the-mill '80s slasher with the strong filmmaking and painterly cinematography of indie drama.  It's an interesting combination, one that would be used in subsequent years by filmmakers like Ti West (THE HOUSE OF THE DEVIL, THE INNKEEPERS) and Adam Wingard (YOU'RE NEXT). It's also very suspenseful (somewhat of a surprise, given the fact that so many of the characters are rather unlikeable) and makes great use of its pop soundtrack, especially the appropriate use of America's ""Sister Golden Hair"" as something of a theme (albeit a cover version).

At least I think every GUY remembers; perhaps women have a beef with this type of person for different reasons.  Well I knew several like that, and it can be a devastating consequence, and rite of passage, of growing up for those who experience it first hand, especially for anyone flirting with an escalating cynicism and existential angst.  That All The Boys Love Mandy Lane incorporates this into an otherwise by-the-numbers, pedestrian dead teenager movie is a bright spot that ultimately makes the ninety minutes worthwhile. Directed by Jonathan Levine (this year's Warm Bodies, perhaps the reason for this film's release after sitting on the shelf for seven years), and starring the doll-faced Amber Heard (uncannily recalling an eighties deer-in-the-headlights Demi Moore), Mandy Lane wastes no time establishing that she is indeed who all the boys want, through conversations between her male peers, and the way Levine's camera lingers on different parts of her body.  Unfortunately for many of the other boys, one in particular likes her a little too much, and a weekend getaway to a friend's empty ranch house turns deadly when one by one everyone starts dying.   I don't want to reveal too much, so I'll just say that the film does reward the patient.  Much of the film is nothing new, but part of its charm is that's almost the way it has to be in order for it to work; but that's not to say it couldn't have been more entertaining.  Endless conversations about who wants to fuck who, and who has the smallest penis, reek of filler and induce boredom, but Levine does have grander targets in sight.  The nostalgic songs on the soundtrack, given modern emo-esque revamps, along with moments of honest introspection by the characters are an odd fit with the slasher-style narrative, and help to lend the film cohesion through its final moments.  I feel there are a lot of missed opportunities with Mandy Lane, but in light of the unambitious manner in which it presents itself, it has an appropriately suitable payoff.

What strikes me most about All The Boys Love Mandy Lane is the almost unnoticeable yet clearly present self-awareness.  While many slashics this film is stylistically influenced by possess poorly written, downright idiotic characters; Forman writes these characters knowing this. Before the killings start, we're stuck with juvenile, sexist, unfriendly, vapid, and stereotypical delinquents which reflect some of the worst qualities of modern teenagers; all of them except Mandy Lane.  Mandy Lane is everyone's dream girl, an all American beauty with the figure of a pin up girl and the face of a supermodel. She's the girl every guy in school dreams to get but have yet to succeed. She doesn't deliberately tease guys with her sexuality nor does she yearn to be considered ""popular"".

I found it very stupid with few scares and a villain who could not even fright my four year old brother. Not even the nice twist at the end could save this movie. It was just aweful, I hated the characters, the dialogue, the script, the story, and most of the performances. I dont even know under what genre I can categorize All the Boys Love Mandy Lane as it didnt feel like a horror movie and it wasnt gory enough for a slasher film. Amber Heard was the only actress in this film who was likeable, while the rest of the cast I could care less for and in most cases every death was more of a relief than a feeling of actual horror. Yes there were some nice death scenes but they werent executed to well. First of all in order for a slasher film to be effective you need a scary villain. Maybe the producers never intended this to be scary and wanted to make some other point, but I never got it. Second the editing was just too distracting for my taste along with several shots that were terribly executed.  I guess the director was trying to be original, but it felt amateur instead. Everytime the plot seemed to be going somewhere it went in a completely different direction and unfortunately it wasnt for the best. At first it seemed the murderer was not going to be showed until the very end and the viewer was going to have to guess who the killer was like in Scream or most other teen slasher films, but halfway through the film it is revealed to us in an anticlimatic fashion. I will give the director credit in that he tried to make a different movie, but it still failed to be entertaining or enlightening. Amber Heard however was probably the only good thing in this movie as her performance was the only thing that felt real.",3,10,0,214,"2,168",24/6/13,rated-3

Eine Zeit die sich fast ausschließlich mit Oberflächlichkeiten beschäftigt. Bin ich zu fett? Bin ich zu dünn? Warum bin ich unbeliebt? Warum bin ich Außenseiter? Mögen mich die Jungs nur weil ich hübsch bin? Oft nostalgisch verklärt, war es doch für viele von uns eine Zeit zum vergessen. Und genau damit beschäftigt sich Jonathan Levines Film unter dem Vorwand eines Slashers. Mandy Lane ist die Perfektion nach der alle streben. Warum weiß eigentlich niemand so recht, am wenigsten sie selbst. Und trotzdem ist sie die unerreichbare Gottheit. Die Unschuld und doch das Sexidol. Die heilige Maria Magdalena wenn man so will oder die berühmte Lolita. In vielen Ansätzen ist das ziemlich smart umgesetzt im Film. Obwohl der Film nahezu alle gängigen Tropes nutzt, wirkt er erstaunlich frisch. Auch die Abkehr vom Hochglanz zurück zum Grindhouse in der optischen Darstellung mit seinen körnigen Bildern, erhöhten Kontrasten und gleichzeitiger Farblosigkeit bekräftigt diesen Eindruck.  Für einen richtigen Slasher ist AtBLML fast schon zu zahm in seiner Gewaltdarstellung. Heute mehr als ein Jahrzehnt später wäre der Film wohl deutlich drastischer in seiner Ausrichtung. Auch Sympathien verteilt der Film kaum. Hier und da kommt es sogar zu einigen langweiligen Passagen. Der Twist am Ende ist reine Geschmackssache. Mir hat das Finale jedoch zugesagt. _______________________________________________________________________________ Mandy Lane probably reminds many of the cruelties of youth. A time which is almost exclusively concerned with superficialities. Am I too fat? Am I too thin? Why am I unpopular? Why am I an outsider? Do the boys like me just because I'm pretty? Often nostalgically transfigured, it was a time for many of us to forget. And that's exactly what Jonathan Levine's film under the guise of a slasher deals with. Mandy Lane is the perfection everyone strives for. Why does no one, least of all herself, really know And yet she is the unattainable deity. The innocence and yet the sex idol. St Mary Magdalene, if you like, or the famous Lolita. ...which is, in many ways, quite cleverly done in the film. Although the film uses almost all the usual tropes, it seems surprisingly fresh. Also the turning away from high gloss back to grindhouse in the visual presentation with its grainy images, increased contrasts and simultaneous colorlessness reinforces this impression.  For a real slasher AtBLML is almost too tame in its depiction of violence. Today, more than a decade later, the film would probably be much more drastic in its orientation. The film also hardly spreads sympathy. Here and there it even comes to some boring passages. The twist at the end is just a matter of taste.

I've had it on my Horror Movie watch list for a long time so I decided to finally give it a shot and for the first 20ish minutes of the movie I felt like it was being set up to be an interesting horror movie that was a commentary on the genre but from the second the cast stepped foot onto the ranch where the rest of the story took place it was nothing of the sorts.

Since the dawn of junior year men have tried to possess her, and to date all have failed.-Red All the Boys Love Mandy Lane... da fuck why?! We are used to characters in horror films acting idiotic in the face of danger, but this film introduces the stupidity long before any danger rears its head. Apparently all the horndogs in this small town are completely infatuated with Mandy Lane because she's the only girl that hasn't slept with all of them. If that wasn't bad enough, all the slutty girls are constantly in desperate need for Mandy's approval as well. So all these horned up teenagers, male and female, that are constantly having sex, doing drugs and drinking are all after what seems to be the only virgin in the town. It makes sense, because as history has proven it's always the virgins that are the most popular kids in high school. I say that because it's the only possible reason everyone is infatuated with Mandy Lane. She's played by Amber Heard, so she's ""hot"" yes, but the film shows she's not the only ""hot"" girl at school. So maybe it's her personality? Nope, cuz she has none. In fact she hardly talks... or does anything else for that matter. She is just ""there"" as the boys drool on her and the girls so desperately want to be her friend. So I guess it's cuz she's a virgin, cuz that's the only thing she has going for her. I liked 50/50. I loved Warm Bodies. Both those films along with this one were directed by Jonathan Levine so I thought this would be decent at the very least. Levine clearly understands the trappings of horror and knows how to capture violence on film, but here he just doesn't have a proper script to shoot. It's devoid of any likeable characters and that includes Mandy Lane. That last part is crucial because if she's devoid of personality or likeability then the entire premise of the film falls apart.",5,20,3,442,"6,779",15-Apr-14,rated-3

Anyway, I've seen this before on DVD, many many years ago. I think i last saw it in my first year of high school. Recommendation of this girl i used to have a crush on. We'd stand in food tech and talk about horror films a LOT. Anyway, i loved it back then, but of course my mind hadn't fully developed.  The story is this. Mandy Lane gets REALLY hot over the summer after hitting puberty big time, and immediately jocks and anyone else with a cock starts paying attention to her. After she's invited to a party, her best mate talks a jock who wants to get off with her in to impressing her, to differentiate himself from everyone else who just wants to get in to her knickers. Doing this, he dies in the process, and Mandy decides to end their friendship. We pick up a while after. I think it's like a year, i forgot. And she's invited out to a ranch by a pot head, who i SWEAR TO FUCK IS ALWAYS SMOKING IT! Clearly the writers of this have never gotten high a day in their lives, you can't just keep smoking pot non stop day till night. That's not how it works. Anyway he's in the film. There are a bunch of slutty coke nosed girls there with image issues. I can't imagine why they know the pot head who's ranch they're staying at. They don't seem compatible as friends. And yeah, anyway, among the bad cliche teen dialogue, people start dying. The movie has a pretty decent atmosphere. It's shot BRILLIANTLY. But the thing is, it only gets good towards the pictures closure. Seriously, it's very plain and cliche up until the last... what, ten minutes? They were fantastic. I kept thinking to myself. If only the whole movie was this good leading up to the ending. It's a brilliant twist. Such a good finale in fact, that it's the reason i'm being so generous with the rating here.

All the boys may love Mandy Lane but all the boys won't love this film.However.Most boys would probably say that Amber Heard is one of the most stunningly beautiful actresses out there and you could potentially watch this film with the sound turned off and still fully enjoy it.But people such as myself, people who might not be such a big fan of the blonde, will most likely still agree with the first statement - this film is indeed one that you could watch with the sound off because it's simply not that good. While the twist is nice, there's really nothing original here and for the most part, the characters are people so nasty that you don't care if they get whacked anyway.I believe the impact would have been greater if the characters were likeable, which also would have made the twist more diabolical. But all that still wouldn't change the fact that this is the most stereotypical thing I have EVER seen.Making all the characters play nice wouldn't do much good unless they went and had a personality transplant.Not only is Mandy Lane loved by everyone because she's oh so beautiful, but she's also oh so unaware of her own attractiveness. Pleeeeeease, give me a break.And every single other character is carved so perfectly out of the stereotype tree and fed stereotype-steroids that it becomes an impossible mission to look at for more than five minutes at a time without getting brain damaged. Rating it two stars might be an overly nice gesture, but it never managed to really bore me enough to walk over and switch it off.

All the Boys Love Mandy Lane is a fantastic throwback to one of the more exciting genres in movie history: the 80's slasher.  It has the perfect amount of blood, plenty of laughs and more than it's share of sexual depravity. My big issue was that it tried to modernize itself. That sounds like an unfair complaint. After all, who can blame Levine and company for wanting to make their film look like it came out in the 21st century? I just felt like they could have embraced the stereotypes and ran with it a little more.

That was the story of a good man who did a bad thing. GRADUATION is the portrait of a society where nobody can do the right thing because nobody ever does the right thing. Practically the first thing we see is a rock being through a window, and the victim, protagonist Romeo, calls a repairman but not very much weight is put on it though he ""kinda"" ""knows"" who it was. Later, somebody messes with his windshield wipers and it rolls off him. Later still, a rock hits his car window. None of these rhymed crimes is ever solved, largely because ... it's the environment, to which everybody has adapted himself, because it's human nature to adapt to whatever surrounds you. Every relationship in 2016 Romania is either transactional or immediately assumed to be so. And safely assumed, because it usually is. Corruption, the assumption of it, the pragmatic acceptance of it as ""how stuff gets done"" — they all pervade every conversation. Even the police offhandedly (the key point ... Mungiu underlines very little) refer to learning about crimes from tipsters who bribe ambulance drivers. Even as the film's central narrative event happens (the assault on Romeo's daughter on the eve of her baccalaureate exams), we see Romeo as an adulterer (later, we learn, with his wife's ""don't ask, don't tell"" semi-connivance). We very promptly learn after the assault, even before the narrative implications have really been set up, that he and ""Vlad Ivanov"" had bribed their way out of the military draft and thus ""owe"" someone re a liver transplant. Romeo is a doctor. GRADUATION is not the story of a good man corrupted, but of a corrupt man trying to do ""good"" (when it serves him and his) because society runs on corruption. It's well rationalized mind you, and not just on pragmatic grounds. ""People should help one another"" (who disagrees with that?). ""Things can only work out if there's trust"" (""trust"" is bad?). Romeo's wife has religious icons in her bedroom and voices reservations about his test-rigging plans. But she is not merely ineffectual but the object of a withering criticism by Romeo. The husband goes beyond Nietzsche's Zarathustra, who contentedly walked past the religious old man, muttering only to himself ""doesn't he know God is dead."" Instead, Romeo directly notes her complicity, her knowledge, and in some cases her cooperation in everything he had done to get where he was. He's not wrong. And the next generation has learned well, despite the ""hopeful"" flag-draped last shot. At a moment of medical crisis, Romeo's daughter knows she can find him — at his mistress's pad. Nor does she act surprised when her father tells her how to mark her test so it'll get the maximum grade she needs*. She knows how the game of Romanian Life is played. And in a late scene, the son of Romeo's mistress throws rocks (yes, throws parallel rocks) at a couple of other kids at a playground. Reason? Their parents had picked them up to climb onto a crossing bridge that could only have one child on it at a time, effectively ""skipping the line."" Unjustly. And injustice rationalizes sin. The thing that struck me most about Mungiu's direction of this scenario is his sharply critical use of egalitarian framing. Yes, Sonny, there's lots of shots of the camera following people from close and/or behind, which emphasizes subjectivity and personal movement through the world one is negotiating. But the exceptions stand out. At numerous moments, Mungiu frames two people in static medium shots from the side, the composition finely balanced with one person on the left and the other on the right. This is as close as cinema allows to the objective third-person POV common in the 19th century social novel, a form I instinctively compared GRADUATION to at the New York Film Festival last year. Whenever such a composition occurs, what is being discussed is some form of corruption, backscratching, corner-cutting. What is being said is the ugly objective truth that the gods see but humans rationalize when they're framed in other shots. --------------------------------- * Analogous case about children's knowledge: As a  boy of about 9, my grandfather was taking me to see a soccer game involving Rangers, the Protestant team in Glasgow. I pulled out to wear for warmth my school scarf, the only one I had, and my mother said not to wear it. She said it was green and people might think it was for Celtic, Glasgow's Catholic team and Rangers' rivals. I protested that it was an unmistakably different shade of green, bottle green rather than Celtic's kelly green, and trimmed in dark gold rather than Celtic's orange-yellow and white. No matter. I told that anecdote at a grad-school seminar for a paper on sectarianism, producing much mirth when I noted that this was history's first recorded case of a mother telling her son not to wear a scarf outside. But after the laughter had died down, a fellow student said, ""what I find interesting is that even at age 9, you argued the point on whether it looked like the wrong team's scarf. BUT YOU KNEW that you couldn't wear it if there was a risk people would mistake it.""",10,34,2,150,760,14-Apr-17,rated-9

Both Lise and I noticed Graduation when it made it’s debut at Cannes, but despite all my sweeties efforts, we just couldn’t fit it in to a sane timeslot (  9am the next day after the annual LB/TIFF meetup can’t be considered sane. ) Although not in all, especially if you look at the entire population of the planet, to be young is to have a sense of righteous optimism.  The world is yours to change, and you can be true in your quest.  I grew up in the 60’s, although too young to be part of the youth movement back then.  The old, in the view of these youth, had compromised.  The establishment values their comfort and money above all else, and no longer wants to change the world.  The old look upon the young and think about how they thought that way back then .. how they would change the world … and then things gradually changed.  Things changed because of familial responsibilities, things changed because of being worn down, things changed because of the want of a better lot for your offspring, and in some cases things changed because greed and selfishness were too powerful to resist, and too easy a road to take.  The old look down upon the young as being naïve and in some cases ungrateful, but, there is always that nagging doubt about the path taken. Many from the West, including me, simply assume systematic corruption in a former Eastern Bloc in the older generation is simply entrenched.  Graduation shines a misty light on the subject.  Our protagonist, a successful MD, Romeo, played with incredible skill by Adrian Titieni, keeps his motivations elusive.  He enjoys his place, he strives for something better for his daughter, who is about to write her incredibly important high school graduation exams, but at the same time we see his dissatisfaction with his life, and hints of how he and his wife returned to Romania to change their country … so long ago. Writer / Director Cristian Mungiu does a brilliant job of casting light, and casting doubt, about the seeds of corruption.  While my feeling going into the film was ‘that’s simply how things are done over there’, at the end I wasn’t so sure.  If someone in my past did me a favour without any strings attached, and then they come to me years later because they have a real need that I can help with … a need that I’m in a position to help with … if desperate, should they not ask?  If I see their situation, should I not help?  A few years ago I saw a TED talk where a somewhat known and respected Canadian spoke about our healthcare system.  She needed a hip replacement … one of the longest waiting list operations in Canada.  Her primary physician told her it could be ‘up to six months’.  He also hinted that if she volunteered at the hospital, and on her next appointment with the specialist she wore her hospital ID badge, it might help.  Indeed it did.  She gamed the system.  In Canada, not Romania. Many hippies from the sixties became stockbrokers.  Where is the line between a genuine, honest, favour and graft?  Between righteousness and reality?

Though with only a few titles under his belt, his last two; 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days and  Beyond the Hills both knocked me out to the point where he instantaneously become one of those few directors of whom, when they have a picture coming out, they have my full attention.   Both were critiquing his home nation, one on the hopelessness for young women in need of abortions  and the other on an even more archaic and insane religious mindset, Graduation continues in this tradition, showing that in Mungiu’s opinion, Romania still has room for improvements.   I’m excited to say that I really loved this film and this type is the reason I watch as many as I do from all over the world, it is to track down gems like this.  No special effects, no glitz and glamour, just good, solid story telling executed by a modern master of the craft.  Don’t expect a polished and hyper edited product like you are used to from your local multiplex, this is minimalist film making with long takes and the  use of hand held filming in a lot of situations.  Removing all of these bells and whistles you may be used to also removes another one of the filters of reality between you and the screen, allowing you to fully emerge into the dense story and let these characters come to life in a hyper realistic way.  Stylistically it looks like something the Dardennes brothers would make but with bleak,  stiflingly oppressive bureaucratic themes and the heart-wrenching interpersonal family dynamics of an Asghar Farhadi film.   This is going to sound odd but the way this very somber story progresses felt like an episode of Larry David’s Curb Your Enthusiasm except without absolutely any humor of any kind.  That show is cleverly written in a schematic format wherein every day and each episode is the next worst day of Larry’s life.  It is elaborately constructed  so that throughout the episode all of the events and characters are interconnected and overlap with each other and inevitably fold in on themselves right into Larry’s lab by the end.  So the story goes for Romeo,  the protagonist of Graduation. He is a middle-aged doctor and is undergoing the most stressful point in his life.  Every new scenes adds an additional problem for him and the tension is constantly being ratcheted up as the suspense mounts; he is having an affair, his mother is ill, his dauther assaulted etc etc etc.  In short, he is in way over his head. Graduation takes a look at the hypocrisy of the patriarchal dominated Romanian government through our central character's existence within it.  Everything is a constant bureaucratic juggling act, a never ending exchange of favors that pass from hand to hand like an unwanted chain letter.  This corruption has infiltrated all branches of the government  from the medical, criminal justice  and the educational.  For instance one might make sure someone else’s name get bumped up an organ recipient list if in turn their child gets accepted to a good school and so on and so forth.  The system is constantly being exploited and this film questions the murky ethics involved in such interactions.  Thematically the most important ethical question this film will make you think about is whether in raising your children to be honest and upstanding citizens, wanting what’s best for them and to give them the best possible future,  would you be willing to bend some of those rules yourself to ensure all of that.  This is a film that explores action and reaction as wells as consequences both deserved and undeserved.    It examines where we look to place blame in order to find answers and at point we need to just all take responsibility for the inevitable outcome of our own lives.   This is gripping storytelling at its most undiluted and effective.  Finally.   Favorites of 2016 so far ",5,27,0,381,"1,543",2-Jan-17,rated-9

Was I born not giving a shit about ice cube trays? Assuming not, then who is determining our fate? Our parents, no doubt have a hand in that. They shape so much of our lives and the paths we follow, and they do it because they love us but in doing so they rob us of our freedom, especially when they don't always know when it's appropriate to let go.  This takes that nugget, sets it against a crumbling, fractured Romanian bureaucratic backdrop, and runs it parallel with physical assault. Mungiu's sparse use of music and penchant for long, tension-inducing long takes sells the sentiment. He also answers the question: what if Tony Soprano wasn't a Jersey mob boss but a big-city Romanian doctor with a soft, moral centre who could get beaten up by a teenager?

Actually, I became absolutely infatuated with movies close to a couple of years ago, at the age of 15. But my love for them was always a love of movies made in the US/UK. I wasn't interested in checking out movies which were in a different language, out of dumbness I guess. But people change, and I guess I changed. I checked out ""The Hunt"", then ""Blue is the Warmest Colour"" and then ""4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days"". I was hooked from that point on. And out of the three I loved the Romanian one the most, because of how Mungiu could direct incredibly tense scenes with only dialogue and long takes.  I have never seen such great directing before, probably because I've never heard of the Romanian New Wave of movies which swept a few editions of the Cannes Film Festival. Then, I saw ""Beyond the Hills"" which was good, but nowhere near the greatness of  ""4, 3, 2"". Today, synchronized with the Cannes Film Festival premiere were a few advanced screenings of ""Graduation"", these being advertised as ""The World Premiere"". I got to attend such a premiere and I was blown away, no, I was incredibly satisfied. It tells the drama of a family which is going through a tough time, the exam that will decide whether or not their daughter will get a scholarship which will allow her to go to England to study psychology at Cambridge University. The kid is unfortunately assaulted one day before the first exam starts and one of the injuries is exactly done to the hand, the same hand she will need to use in order to write her paper. One family member then goes through some great feats in order to obtain the daughter a higher grade than deserved. Those feats will have some terrible consequences, both to the family members and many of who surround said family members. A lot of things are left to interpretation, a trademark of Mungiu's movies.It's very interesting how many themes come into play and how interconnected some things get to the point where you're sitting there wondering ""Is it?"" or ""Is it not?"". Acting is wonderful, the main character is played masterfully by an actor whom I've never seen on screen before, but who I am looking forward to check out in the future. The cinematography is one of the other really strong points of the movie, Mungiu resorting once again to a very natural look and really lenghty shots, the whole movie probably has around 200 shots, some long takes going as far as 5-6 minutes long, the look he tries to emulate replicates the feeling of a Romanian town from the mountains perfectly; Dark and kind of shabby, almost old looking, with some technology scattered around in almost an undeserving canvas is another thing which tries to show the discrepancy of how behind our people have remained compared to other countries, a thing which the father reminds his daughter many times throughout the film. This isn't Mungiu's best, but I consider it way better than ""Beyond the Hills"" and close to his masterpiece ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"". I really hope this will get the recognition it deserves from the critics at Cannes and that as many people will go watch it since it really attacks a subject as simple as an exam, and it adds suspense and a convoluted plot which in the end demonstrates that we probably care about the people around us too much, or it shows that doing things that seem right at the time aren't in actuality right, or it simply says that events spanning a time of 4 days have the ability to bring an entire family to the ground.

He also hinted that if she volunteered at the hospital, and on her next appointment with the specialist she wore her hospital ID badge, it might help.  Indeed it did.  She gamed the system.

Graduation,2016,127,drama, , , ,6307,7 fans,3.61,16,32,42,174,329,1062,1665,2114,640,233," [6] The jury awards for Cannes 2016 have already been properly excoriated, and I feel no particular need to salt the earth here. But I do have to wonder. Even accounting for the vagaries of taste and the flat-out lack of qualifications of most actors to evaluate the technical side of cinema, how can a sane person look at Mungiu's Graduation and Puiu's Sieranevada and honestly conclude that the former is better directed than the latter? Anyway, here we have a perfectly serviceable arthouse drama that explores Mungiu's favorite theme - the top-to-bottom corruption and decay that is Romanian society - in the form of a group of professional men helping each other out with backroom deals and handshake agreements that seem ""victimless"" enough until the illegalities begin unravelling beneath them. In its own simple way, Graduation has an almost symmetrical narrative arc, with favors set in place in the first part, and the conclusion beginning when those favors start becoming exposed as bribery, influence-peddling, or graft. Since Mungiu loves nothing more than bitter irony, the focus of Graduation is the family of Romeo (Adrien Titieni), a bourgeois doctor who returned to Romania from an unspecified exile, with his now-estranged wife (Lia Bugnar), after the 1991 revolution. Romeo was and is an honest man, and he'd hoped to participate in building a democratic, post-Ceaucescu future. This project having failed - the post-Communist generation in Romania, it seems, being too damaged to ever be whole - Romeo pins all his hopes on his daughter Eliza (Maria-Victoria Dragus), scoring high enough on her finals that she can keep her scholarship to attend college in the U.K. (The film's very premise, of course, is pre-Brexit; now Eliza would have to jump through a multitude of new hoops to even visit Great Britain.) Things don't go as planned, and before long Romeo finds himself negotiating with the head of school, a local customs head, and other more remote figures in a chain of mutual back-scratching, just to make absolutely certain that Eliza gets what she has rightfully earned. Mungiu wants us to see that present-day Romania is morally compromised down to its very core, such that even ""honest"" men like Romeo cannot avoid the taint of corruption. What's more, by showing us the hypocrisy of Romeo's personal life, where he is anything but honest,  Mungiu gives the lie to Romeo's self-righteousness. Mungiu's searing irony - that Romania is a cesspool and no once can stay clean no matter how far above it one tries to remain - is all a bit shallow. But then I tended to feel the same way about the Kafkaesque horror show Mungiu orchestrated for the two young women in 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, a film now considered a modern classic. There's a kind of jury-rigging in his films that results from the too-convenient overlay of narrative contrivance and political critique, such that it's hard to give in entirely to the latter. As with his Iranian colleague Asghar Farhadi, the former is always tooled for maximum impact. Besides, it's unclear whether we're really looking in the right place for the real story. The ostensible focus of Graduation is on a father's machinations on his daughter's behalf, even if they do not really benefit her in the end. But if we consider the role of women in this film, a different picture emerges. Eliza's mother Magda is effectively sidelined, someone who appears to have taken a less prestigious career path (library science) in order to allow her husband to study medicine. Romeo's girlfriend Sandra (Malina Manovici) works at the hospital, but is not taken seriously by Romeo; we also see Romeo treating his female colleagues as assistants, even though their rank is unclear.  But perhaps most important, the confrontation between Romeo and Eliza's boyfriend Marius (Rares Andrici) seems to bring to light some damning information that no one in the film is prepared to follow up on. While it is framed as though Marius saw Eliza being attacked and just moved along without helping, there is every indication that her attacker was one of Marius's friends. That is, Marius may have set the whole thing up to sandbag Eliza's baccalaureate exam so she would have to stay in Cluj with him instead of going to the U.K. This is never considered, or at least Romeo doesn't press the issue. And Eliza is going to take Marius's side in any case, as we see near the end of the film.  So while Mungiu displays the corruption of Romania as a series of dirty deals among seemingly honest men, we should consider that the greater moral decay lay in the margins. This is a film about a man taking too many liberties with the women in his life, in a culture that allows men to exchange women amongst themselves like chits. And the worst part of it is, Eliza is remaining within this sexist network by choice. It's all she has ever known.",9,33,0,145,"4,525",3-Dec-16,rated-6

I'll toss another contemporary with similar aesthetic choices and structuring the film around an increasingly complex moral decision - Asghar Farhadi. And perhaps its this familiarity with the tropes, styles, and ideas, despite Graduation's very good qualities, makes the film very good instead of great. The second half of the film picks up for me. I appreciate the film's ending allows for discussion. The kids are alright or are they doomed?  Discussing these elements with people after the film, however, it became apparent that this ambiguous nature of the film, for whatever reason despite some great central performances, doesn't resonate with the depth or fury it should.

Tell the truth and jeopardize a loved one's future? Or tell a lie and free them from the corrupting influence of a country gone south? Mungiu goes full-blown Kieślowski by way of the Dardenne brothers, which is another way to say he painfully examines the moral choices of people who make wrongdoing seem right, and right-doing seem unfair, but never blames them for their warped logic but instead makes us feel the intensity of their panic. This could very well belong to the DEKALOG series, an alternate version to ""Thou shalt not bear false witness,"" where bearing false witness becomes a moral obligation to save a loved one from national corruption, and telling the truth means sentencing them to a life spoiled by crime and absent of opportunity.  In the title of the film we hear the ringing complexity of what these characters are up against: A father's daughter is about to graduate from high school and enter the adult world of a corrupt Romanian society. It is through his web of deceit, however, that she'll be given a chance to leave the perverted land and lead a new life abroad. Would you do it? Would you tell a lie if it meant the future stability of your loved one? Maybe damning yourself with a guilty conscience is the high price paid for loving someone enough to save them from systematic immorality. Or maybe damning yourself in this way is just the inevitable outcome of having lived under a corrupt regime for so long.  GRADUATION speaks to the outrage and disillusionment of Romanian citizens having lived under the Ceausescu regime for decades. It mourns over the possibility of improving a corrupt Romanian society, and rages over the immoral infection that's implicated the country in conspiracy. Bold, unblinking, and subjectively airtight, it's a film about the fragility of our ethics, the compromise of our values, and the great lengths we go to protect our own.

Graduation fits alongside the terrific, naturalistic, moral quandaries Asghar Farhadi tackles in his films and though it may be a bit overstuffed in comparison to the leaner, narrower focus of 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, this is still a strong, thought-provoking film.

In addition to the hot-button issue that instigates the plot, the insurmountable fear of imposing exams and the dearth of ethics would presumably strike chords in quite a few people. Nonetheless, Graduation is definitely a worthwhile watch due to Mungiu's dedication to showing things as they (presumably) are in Romania, and on its own merits as a compelling morality tale in its own right. The morning before Doctor Romeo Aldea's daughter Eliza is slated to take a series of exams pivotal for graduation and a scholarship to Cambridge, Eliza is assaulted just outside the school. Romeo is informed only after the matter, and then decides to take matters into his own hands - not necessarily to find the perpetrator, but rather find avenues to secure a future for his talented daughter at a critical juncture in her life. Said avenues may or may not violate every value he's raised his daughter with. From the outset Mungiu excels at painting an immersive, bleak portrait of Romania, often through his characters. Romeo himself is a heavily flawed individual - from the film's opening we see his rather callous regard for his deteriorating marriage, as if his affair with Sandra, a teacher at Eliza's school, might have been the catalyst for the horrors inflicted on his daughter. However, he remains a very caring father and an honest doctor burdened with a very plausible situation. Mungiu's focus on Romeo not only forces viewers into speculation over what they might do, but also allows them to confront the dilemma of how much a parent's regard for their child's success might be more out of bitterness for their own shortcomings (among the topics Romeo discusses with his wife and friends, whom we can assume potentially grew up together or at least knew each other for decades, is their generation's failure to have changed much in their town), and the precarious balance over lending autonomy over safeguarding a child. Leading man Adrian Titieni is excellent as Romeo, challenging viewers to do some soul-searching and potentially empathize with him. Mungiu's film brings Asghar Farhadi's The Salesman to mind in certain ways, but deviates from the path of the latter by delving into different sobering truths. While a portion of the plot is dedicated to the search for justice, the majority of Romeo and Eliza's focus lies on the tests among other matters. It's almost as if they lack any hope whatsoever of the perpetrator getting caught, and the police remain alone in believing in the efficacy of their work. The film also makes note of Romeo's lamentation of corruption even as he dabbled in it when it suits him or his daughter; but in the film's glimmers of hope he gets a degree of redemption when confronted with the necessity of addressing certain issues head on. These are but a few of Mungiu's ruminations that bolster Graduation into a potent work. The visual style of Graduation also proves striking. The film opts frequently for lengthy, often static takes as characters converse, making viewers feel as if they're sharing the same room. This style works to a fault in that the film could indeed benefit from trimming in places (a certain subplot with potentially symbolic events lacks the vitality of the main narrative), but it also allows for a feel as welcoming as a film with such palpable pessimism could be.  In a just industry Graduation would presumably be a contender in the American awards season, but even without those accolades the film's searing dramatic flair and outpouring of bitterness make for a unique, thought-provoking watch. Thanks to the good people at Netflix for putting it in their platform. Verdict: A-",7,6,0,113,256,15-Jan-18,rated-8

Firstly, the tone of the graduation felt very off from the get go. A graduation should be a symbol of prosperity and future opportunities in life, but the introduction to the heads of school felt like some surreal horror scene out of a Lanthimos feature. The way people were ushered around felt like some kind of cult offering which again added to the off tone to the overall graduation.  In terms of the production, the set looked great, very spacious yet full of life, worked very well in my opinion. The sound design however, my god. Possibly the worst sound quality in my viewing experience. Most names were drowned out in a storm of static and it really pulled me out of my immersion. Very low quality for the budget of this ceremony.  Overall the graduation was gushing with imperfections, but with a kind of 'so bad it's funny' kind of vibe.

Both movies cover pretty much the same basic ground – Romania is super-corrupt, everything there sucks, you have to know the right people and/or have enough money to ensure your child has a bright future, yada yada yada. This may have felt fresh and new about a decade earlier when Mungiu made 4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days and Turkey Girl (his segment in the 2005 anthology Lost and Found), but it feels very tired now in a been-there-done-that kind of way. To be fair, Graduation is not without its merits, including a strong lead performance by Adrian Titieni and Vlad Ivanov's small role as a corruption-prone police officer. However, there are also many weak points here – poorly written characters (especially the sickly mother who doesn't have much to do), scenes that lead nowhere (like the father possibly hitting a dog while driving or his amateur investigation into the attack on his daughter), and many loose threads (we never find out what actually happened to the daughter or who the attacker was). I was entertained enough to finish the movie, but Mungiu, my friend, it's not just Romania – the whole world is one giant shithole. At least as a citizen of an EU member state before Brexit you could potentially go to the UK. Ask some people from non-EU states—perhaps your western neighbors—how difficult it was to even visit the UK as a tourist at the time, not to mention get an opportunity to go to school or move there. Parallels could also be drawn between Graduation and the scandal involving Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, but I don't really care for that story or this movie enough to do it.",4,4,0,24,20,8-Jun-20,rated-4

Everything is going perfect, Eliza has even got two scholarships  lined up and only thing remaining is her to score a 9 pointer in the local examination. But on the day of school Eliza is assaulted and everything that was supposed to smoothly strangles into an unexpected virtue.  The movie focuses on the role of a parent, on how much Romeo can go. We also see the situation of the country and its stands on assaults on women. Many times it is mentioned like a daily thing for the people. You can even see how no one noticed or ignored the assault that was happening to Eliza. There are conversations where people say casually it would have much worse or it just happens. It was just baffling to watch it. Even recently on New Years a girl was assaulted in Bangalore much like Eliza, at first the authorities dismissed the girl, when found out on footage we see people just walking by noticing it. Where is the humanity gone? And even in 21st Century why is this even happening? And why women still have to fight for their rights?  Let me focus on the movie first. As Eliza is still having difficulties to focus and having important exam right away, Romeo tries to influence her grade by talking to the right people. But as an hard working student and living her life in honesty Eliza finds it difficult to accept what her father is offering and influencing.  The relationship between Eliza and Romeo slides even down when she finds out about his affair with an ex patient of his.  What we really see in Graduation is how a parent who has struggled to become what he or she has with a country that isn't changing much, has not really a safety for women, assaults are casual discussion and 'It Happens' sentence which hurts the most. It is a basic thinking of a parent to do whatever is necessary for his child. We see Romeo trying to go over and beyond for Eliza, you can become angry with him when he tries to push her to give the exam after her assault.  We also see Eliza trying little to breakaway from her fathers decision, she starts to doubt weather she wants to leave. Yet we can still say she wants to go, she is just trying to figure it out herself.  The brilliance that depicts the  movie is the screenplay, which gradually moves forward without creating any forced or over ambitious or even getting provoked. Cristian Mungiu has brilliantly showed the world he lives in as it is. He shows the naturalism of each situation. The breaking point of Eliza, her anger towards her father, even though she understands but wants to rebel somehow.  The movie never provokes you to be angry at someones, it just shows you how deprived we have become as a society. If you have loved Cristian Mungiu's brilliant masterpiece 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days you will surely love this. You will see the style, the tension, the reality Cristian Mungiu creates.  Graduation is about a parent trying to graduate in life by making his daughter become something more than he his even better. It is about the struggle and compromise, the implications one do. It is brilliant in every way. It will make you have goosebumps at points. Cristian Mungiu even tries to have a blinker of hope from today's youth from his country. He wants them to stay and make the difference and one day he might show what they have changed rather than scaring away the world from Romania.",9,27,3,195,"3,105",16-Jan-17,rated-10

They give us shelter, pay the electricity bills, keep us warm, pay the data plans for our phones, drive us to school and make sure we get the best education there is. But is a parent willing to sacrifice their sanity and dignity for the sake of their child?  This moral dilemma is put into test in Christian Mungiu's Baccalaureate, a film that exemplifies a parent's worst nightmare while still give us an eye-opening look into the corruption-blotched society of Romania. Moody, bleak and dread-filled, this is a harrowing cautionary tale of family, decisions and regrets and Mungiu has crafted yet again another nerve-twisting film that will keep you guessing from start till long after the film is even over.  The constrained relationship between a daughter and her father makes the crux of the plot. Romeo, a reputed doctor whose influence is quite alarming, finds himself in a awry situation when his daughter, Eliza, gets assaulted while on her way to write college to write her exam. Romeo's dream of Eliza getting a scholarship to the UK gets shattered when Eliza fares the exam poorly and has to get a perfect 10 on her next exams. What happens next is a whirlwind of emotion and tension all meticulously balanced with some superb writing and sharp direction.  This is a film that unveils a broken and morally deprived society through the eyes of the characters. The antagonist in Mungiu's story is yet again a decrepit and sleazy Romanian society that has corruption rampant through each hospital, police station and school and how innocent people have no other choice but to push themselves through this shithole to come clean the other side. He juggles these themes of corruption, bureaucracy, morality and parental instinct through a simple but layered storyline. The film does have shades of Haneke and Farhadi that feels evident in scenes involving glass and the ending, respectively The acting is absolutely top notch. Adrian Titieni's portrayal as the flawed but relentless Romeo, whose weathered and tired face speaks volumes of the tribulations he bears and love for his daughter, is endearing to watch. We sympathize him in some situations that we wish never happens to anyone else and feel the same level of anxiety as him. All the performances were flawless and great all around. The cinematography is completely handheld and there's and emphasis of depth of focus and mise-en-scene along with some absolutely fantastic one shot sequences that's amazing to watch.  The plot of the film is much more procedural and complex in contrast to Mungiu's previous film 4 Months, 3 Weeks, 2 Days. You will feel kinda lost in this madness because there's so much happening both on and off-screen that alot of interpretation goes straight out of the window. The dense plot along with the political critique didn't really mesh with each other and that's my only flaw. Nonetheless, this is one wild ride of a film. A film that feels more like a incoming panic attack than a sudden one, this is one marvelous film that proves that Christian Mungiu is easily one of the best directors working today.

That was the story of a good man who did a bad thing. GRADUATION is the portrait of a society where nobody can do the right thing because nobody ever does the right thing. Practically the first thing we see is a rock being through a window, and the victim, protagonist Romeo, calls a repairman but not very much weight is put on it though he ""kinda"" ""knows"" who it was. Later, somebody messes with his windshield wipers and it rolls off him. Later still, a rock hits his car window. None of these rhymed crimes is ever solved, largely because ... it's the environment, to which everybody has adapted himself, because it's human nature to adapt to whatever surrounds you. Every relationship in 2016 Romania is either transactional or immediately assumed to be so. And safely assumed, because it usually is. Corruption, the assumption of it, the pragmatic acceptance of it as ""how stuff gets done"" — they all pervade every conversation. Even the police offhandedly (the key point ... Mungiu underlines very little) refer to learning about crimes from tipsters who bribe ambulance drivers. Even as the film's central narrative event happens (the assault on Romeo's daughter on the eve of her baccalaureate exams), we see Romeo as an adulterer (later, we learn, with his wife's ""don't ask, don't tell"" semi-connivance). We very promptly learn after the assault, even before the narrative implications have really been set up, that he and ""Vlad Ivanov"" had bribed their way out of the military draft and thus ""owe"" someone re a liver transplant. Romeo is a doctor. GRADUATION is not the story of a good man corrupted, but of a corrupt man trying to do ""good"" (when it serves him and his) because society runs on corruption. It's well rationalized mind you, and not just on pragmatic grounds. ""People should help one another"" (who disagrees with that?). ""Things can only work out if there's trust"" (""trust"" is bad?). Romeo's wife has religious icons in her bedroom and voices reservations about his test-rigging plans. But she is not merely ineffectual but the object of a withering criticism by Romeo. The husband goes beyond Nietzsche's Zarathustra, who contentedly walked past the religious old man, muttering only to himself ""doesn't he know God is dead."" Instead, Romeo directly notes her complicity, her knowledge, and in some cases her cooperation in everything he had done to get where he was. He's not wrong. And the next generation has learned well, despite the ""hopeful"" flag-draped last shot. At a moment of medical crisis, Romeo's daughter knows she can find him — at his mistress's pad. Nor does she act surprised when her father tells her how to mark her test so it'll get the maximum grade she needs*. She knows how the game of Romanian Life is played. And in a late scene, the son of Romeo's mistress throws rocks (yes, throws parallel rocks) at a couple of other kids at a playground. Reason? Their parents had picked them up to climb onto a crossing bridge that could only have one child on it at a time, effectively ""skipping the line."" Unjustly. And injustice rationalizes sin. The thing that struck me most about Mungiu's direction of this scenario is his sharply critical use of egalitarian framing. Yes, Sonny, there's lots of shots of the camera following people from close and/or behind, which emphasizes subjectivity and personal movement through the world one is negotiating. But the exceptions stand out. At numerous moments, Mungiu frames two people in static medium shots from the side, the composition finely balanced with one person on the left and the other on the right. This is as close as cinema allows to the objective third-person POV common in the 19th century social novel, a form I instinctively compared GRADUATION to at the New York Film Festival last year. Whenever such a composition occurs, what is being discussed is some form of corruption, backscratching, corner-cutting. What is being said is the ugly objective truth that the gods see but humans rationalize when they're framed in other shots. --------------------------------- * Analogous case about children's knowledge: As a  boy of about 9, my grandfather was taking me to see a soccer game involving Rangers, the Protestant team in Glasgow. I pulled out to wear for warmth my school scarf, the only one I had, and my mother said not to wear it. She said it was green and people might think it was for Celtic, Glasgow's Catholic team and Rangers' rivals. I protested that it was an unmistakably different shade of green, bottle green rather than Celtic's kelly green, and trimmed in dark gold rather than Celtic's orange-yellow and white. No matter. I told that anecdote at a grad-school seminar for a paper on sectarianism, producing much mirth when I noted that this was history's first recorded case of a mother telling her son not to wear a scarf outside. But after the laughter had died down, a fellow student said, ""what I find interesting is that even at age 9, you argued the point on whether it looked like the wrong team's scarf. BUT YOU KNEW that you couldn't wear it if there was a risk people would mistake it.""",10,34,2,150,760,14-Apr-17,rated-9

Tell the truth and jeopardize a loved one's future? Or tell a lie and free them from the corrupting influence of a country gone south? Mungiu goes full-blown Kieślowski by way of the Dardenne brothers, which is another way to say he painfully examines the moral choices of people who make wrongdoing seem right, and right-doing seem unfair, but never blames them for their warped logic but instead makes us feel the intensity of their panic. This could very well belong to the DEKALOG series, an alternate version to ""Thou shalt not bear false witness,"" where bearing false witness becomes a moral obligation to save a loved one from national corruption, and telling the truth means sentencing them to a life spoiled by crime and absent of opportunity.  In the title of the film we hear the ringing complexity of what these characters are up against: A father's daughter is about to graduate from high school and enter the adult world of a corrupt Romanian society. It is through his web of deceit, however, that she'll be given a chance to leave the perverted land and lead a new life abroad. Would you do it? Would you tell a lie if it meant the future stability of your loved one? Maybe damning yourself with a guilty conscience is the high price paid for loving someone enough to save them from systematic immorality. Or maybe damning yourself in this way is just the inevitable outcome of having lived under a corrupt regime for so long.  GRADUATION speaks to the outrage and disillusionment of Romanian citizens having lived under the Ceausescu regime for decades. It mourns over the possibility of improving a corrupt Romanian society, and rages over the immoral infection that's implicated the country in conspiracy. Bold, unblinking, and subjectively airtight, it's a film about the fragility of our ethics, the compromise of our values, and the great lengths we go to protect our own.

Corruption, blackmail and insidious institutions loom oppressively large. When morality has dissipated within the inner workings of society, does it matter if one measly dad bends some rules in order to get his daughter through (and away from) an equally bogus system? That's the central question asked, but there are plenty of others related to peripheral characters that are never answered. There's also a slight hint of surreal forces at play, such as objects being thrown through Romeo's windows with ostensibly no culprit (his conscience maybe? It's the kind of symbolism Mungiu usually likes) and people stacking lies upon lies on top of each other even when photo evidence is in their hands.

A lot of people have said Tunnel balances comedy and drama well but to me, a lot of it felt off. I really appreciated the cartoonish mockery of the government but some of the execution felt out of place; that's not Tunnel's main downfall though, not by a long shot. Tunnel's biggest *tut* moment is the length - a lot of scenes feel repeated because the chances are you've already felt this emotion before in another scene. It should've been nearer to 90 minutes (rather than 120) in my opinion, because a lot of it certainly collapses (pun intended) towards the end. Emotional manipulation 'n all.That being said, I would still say this one is worth a watch when you are in the mood for something less challenging.

Kim Seong-hoon does a wonderful job creating the tense claustrophobic surroundings of a man caught in a collapsed tunnel with nerve shredding effect. On more than one occasion I found myself looking out the window to make sure none of it was real. The pacing drags a little in places but it’s only a minor issue as this mostly delivers the goods. Ha Jung-woo is riveting as the would be imprisoned man. Slowly deteriorating under the pressure of a world only big enough to stretch his legs if he’s lucky. Where he quickly has to make use of his own urine for drinking fluids to survive. And his only friend becomes the dog of a woman who dies mere days after this whole terrifying experience begins. Its greatest success is the way it walks the line between a special effects driven superficial high and heartbreaking introspection of a man abandoned by everyone but his devoted and emotionally crumbling wife.

Wie man unschwer erkennen kann, ist Tunnel / The Tunnel, ein Südkoreanischer Katastrophenfilm, einer von denen. Der eigentliche Grund, warum ich Ihn denn nun auf die Liste gepackt habe liegt bei den Darstellern und der vermeintlich Realistisch gehaltenen Handlung. Damit möchte ich jetzt nicht sagen das Katastrophen wie ein Supergau oder ähnliches nicht Realistisch sind, keineswegs, aber ich glaube das ein eingestürzter Tunnel von all diesen Dingen am Realistischsten ist. (Was schreibst du wieder nur Niklas?) Damit kann man dann auch gleich beginnen, denn die Handlung von diesem Film ist so Simpel wie seinen Namen in einer Buchstabensuppe zu buchstabieren. Lee Jung-Soo, glücklich Verheiratet, fährt eines Tages an dem Geburtstag seiner Tochter durch einen Tunnel, welcher nach weniger Zeit immer mehr und mehr Geräusche von sich gibt, als es eigentlich sein dürfte, bis schließlich das passiert, was auch jeder erwartet hat: Der Tunnel stürzt in sich zusammen. Was dann folgt, ist ein 126 Minütiges Überlebensdrama was in der ein oder anderen Person, durch den eingestürzten Tunnel und der Figur im eingeklemmten Auto, die gute alte Klaustrophobie hervorrufen kann. Ich sag mal so, ich bin froh das ich nicht diese Phobie habe, denn sonst würde es mir das Leben definitiv erschweren. Und mit dem einstürzen des Tunnels beginnt auch ein Rennen gegen die Zeit und der Essensrationen, welcher Lee Jung-Soo mit sich hatte. Mit den Figuren selber hatte ich eine teils schwere Zeit da man vor allem bei unserer Hauptfigur und dem Zuständigen für die Rettungsarbeiten auf einen erzwungenen Humor gesetzt hat, was die Suche nach unserer Hauptfigur ein wenig aufheitern soll, jedoch kläglich scheitert. Nur einmal konnte der Film mir ein schmunzeln entziehen, der Rest aber war total unnötig und sobald eine weitere Figur hinzukam auch noch mehr als unangebracht. Aus meiner Sicht hätte man sich die Humorvolle Seite sparen können und stattdessen mehr Entwicklung in jede einzelne Figur stecken sollen. Filme wie 127 Hours haben gezeigt, wie man einer Figur eine Hintergrundgeschichte gibt wenn jene sich in einer unausweichlichen Situation befinden. Hier ist es einfach nur verschwendetes Potenzial. Dennoch muss ich sagen das ich, bis auf den Humor, kein wirkliches Problem mit den Darstellern hatte, was aber an den Umständen lag an denen man diese kennengelernt hat. Spätestens ab Mi-Na hatte der Film mich mit seinen Figuren überzeugen können, verliert sich aber jedoch später aber wieder in zu verkomplizierten Situationen und dummen Entscheidungen, was es dem Zuschauer wiederum nicht einfach macht diese noch immer zu mögen. Wie oben schon erwähnt gab es zwei Gründe warum ich diesen Film unbedingt sehen wollte. Nr. 1 war die realistisch gehaltene Handlung und Nr. 2 die Darsteller. Diese sind eigentlich sogar der wirkliche Grund warum ich mir diesen Film angeguckt habe. Diejenigen, die Park Chan-wook's The Handmaiden gesehen haben, werde unsere Hauptfigur nur zu gut wiedererkennen werden. Ha Jung-woo hat mich dort schon von seiner besten Seite überzeugt und auch hier konnte er wieder suverän abliefern, selbst wenn diese Rolle hier nicht an die von The Handmaiden rankommt, in keiner Dimension. Bae Doo-na wächst langsam aber sicher immer weiter zu einer meiner Lieblingen in dem Bereich von den Schauspielern ran. Noch nie hat sie mich enttäuscht, sondern immer wieder aufs neue beeindruckt, so auch hier. Ihre Duality ist wie schon in Kingdom der Wahnsinn.  Zu guter letzt kommen wir dann aber nochmal zum Technischen Aspekt von Tunnel. Dafür, das man die meiste Zeit nur den eingestürzten Tunnel samt zerstörten Karre und einer dort eingeschlossen Figur sieht, ist die Cinematography, was das Talent, anderen durch Klaustrophobische Aufnahmen Angst einzujagen, wirklich gelungen. Zwar bietet der Film keine Bilder welche man sich an die Wand hängen kann, aber für das was er versucht zu erreichen, schafft er es definitiv. Jetzt kommen wir mal zu etwas, was ich Positiv und negativ aufgefasst habe, nämlich den Soundtrack. Dieser ist auf Krampf so Emotional wie möglich gehalten und entwickelt sich gegen Ende sogar zu einer richtigen Achterbahnfahrt aus Action- und Emotionalen Score. Dies hat nicht nur tierisch genervt, da man damit versucht hat dem Zuschauer eine Bindung zu den Figuren aufzudrücken, welche im Verlauf aber auch von alleine gekommen wäre, sondern einem auch eine Träne zu entlocken, was zu keiner Zeit wirklich möglich war. Dafür haben die Figuren zu wenig gelitten und zu schnell mit Ihrem Leben abgeschlossen. Am Ende kann ich sagen, das The Tunnel nicht mehr als ein Solider Katastrophenfilm aus dem Südkoreanischen Raum ist, welcher mit einer realistisch gehaltenen Rahmenhandlung, seinen Darstellern und seiner Cinematography glänzen kann. Muss man jetzt nicht unbedingt gesehen haben, außer man liebt solche Filme und hat diesen hier bis jetzt noch nicht gesehen.",8,8,7,51,198,9-Sep-19,rated-6

It briefly establishes Ha Jung-woo's Jung-soo as a good man and a caring father, it details what's in his car at the time of the collapse, and then it throws us directly into the downright scary instigating sequence. That scene does for tunnels what Jaws did for the water, but there's still about two hours of movie after that, depicting Jung-soo's efforts to stay alive, his wife, Se-hyun (Bae Doona, delivering a more emotional performance than her work with the Wachowskis usually allows), and the government's struggle to rescue him, led by Dae-kyung (Oh Dal-su).

The way it does this is by having her standing with a shopping trolley on a travelator. A news anchor on a TV attached to the roof breaks the news. She lets go of her trolley, and walks backwards really quickly in order to stay in the same spot on the Travelator, so that she can look at the TV and watch the news. There are a near infinite ways in which the script could have had her learn that her husband has been buried in a tunnel. And they choose this great way!

Tunnel is the middle point between Sly Stallone 1996 'classic' daylight and one of Billy Wilder's many masterpieces, Ace in the Hole. In which Ha Jung-woo drives through a tunnel which has barely been open a month, a tunnel which collapses with him in it and what follows is a dedicated effort from Seoul to save him. If this was an American film, the guy trapped under the weight of a shifting mountain would be a terrible human and only in the act of surviving under a weight of rocks of debris does he realise that and become born anew. It's a trope which has become impossibly tired that I like to refer to as ""Disney Dad's"". Ha Jung-woo isn't anything of the sort, he is a good family man desperate to survive; no need for an asinine redemption arc. The film is divided between the two ends of the story: the effort to save and the effort to survive. Outside of the cave-in, our eyes on the ground are Ha Jung-woo's wife, the ever wonderful Doo-Na Bae and 'that guy' from every Korean film, Oh Dal-Su. The vortex swirling around them concerns the mass amount of media coverage, the big business who loathe the idea of spending so much money to save one person and the journalists who are more concerned with breaking world records for the news-worthiness than the human cost. Director Kim Seong-hun is giving the establishment the finger and a vital satirical edge to this slick crowd-pleaser.  Under the weight of the shifted rock, we only ever see what Ha Jung-woo does. Pardon the pun but it helps keep the film grounded and ideas well within its station. Little touches like the daily phone check-ins or the only radio station he can get being (basically) Classic FM, its real rather than hyperbolic. The film depicts a horrible situation that is nightmare fuel for the claustrophobic, however, that doesn't mean it can't also be in possession of a great sense of humour. It is a Korean film, after all. Jung-woo's back and forth with Tengie the pug are great and the drinking urine admission is funny too. The last act does leave a few too many questions unanswered but [the] Tunnel is a solidly entertaining and wholesome 'crowd pleaser' reminiscent of those films from an era where that wasn't a dirty phrase.",5,4,0,341,601,10-Mar-18,rated-8

He's got a cake for his daughter, topping the car off with fuel, and heading home. On his way, he calls his wife to let her know how things have been, when suddenly a tunnel he is passing through (newly opened and everything) decides to cave in and trap him inside his car with nowhere to go. With that set up out of the way, let's dive in to one of my favorite films of the year so far, Tunnel. Given director Kim's previous film, A Hard Day, I went into this new film with high anticipation. Add to that the fact that the trio of leads in the film are some of my favorite performers in the region, and you have a recipe for a delicious slice of Korean film goodness, and it most certainly is just that. While very straight-forward, and you can see the light at the end of the........ tunnel (sorry), the journey getting to said end, and the struggle Lee goes through in this film, completely emerges you and has your attention its entire two plus hour runtime. The early scenes, where the tunnel initially collapses as he is driving through, left chills on me, and moments like this scattered about, when the danger redelivers itself time and time aga, haind me on edge, and I loved every moment of it. The melodrama is thick throughout, but it never feels over-the-top. I don't think I've felt feels like this from a film in quite a while. It hits hard, and all of the characters, including some of the smaller ones from the rescue team, working to get Lee out of his awful situation, are well fleshed out, and seemingly all understandable in their thoughts and actions, no matter which side of the fence they are on, with continuing the rescue or not. You get where they are all coming from, and makes the tiniest moments even more impacting. Ha Jeong-woo is absolutely fantastic as Lee Jung-soo, and while the role is more physical in general, with being trapped in such a tiny space for so long, his determination and humanity in the situation really shines through, and sort of feels inspiring. You don't really learn a lot about him, with a secret past or anything like that. He is just a normal human being, and I think that was a very smart thing to have done. The other characters, such as the wife (Bae Doo-na), while not having much to do through the film, as she can't, since there is not much she can do for the situation, serves as the backbone to everything, and her calmness is very soothing given the intensity of it all. Lastly, Oh Dal-soo is as solid as ever as the lead man of the rescue operation. Again, all of the characters and even the plot is very straightforward, but everything works perfectly. In terms of the technical side of the film, again, everything is spot on and perfect for this picture. The cinematography is creative given the tight spacing, the lighting and mood brings a real sense of claustrophobia and the documentary like camerawork with the news crews and such all blend together quite nicely. The pacing never really lets up, except in the middle, but without spoiling, it is perhaps my favorite chunk of the entire film. The music, while a bit to loud for its own good at times, never felt overly intrusive, and more often than not, really helps add to that emotional core that holds everything together. Tunnel is a film worthy of high praise, and I really hope it is one that does well outside of Korea (which is currently doing very well at the box-office). It is human drama at its finest, though it may get a little heavy at times, again, given everything happening, it is completely believable and absorbing. This will without a doubt be in my best of the year when all is said and done. See this film!",8,2,1,18,229,24-Aug-16,rated-9

The film initially desires to capture the enduring terror and overall resilience in Jung-Soo Lee (Jung-woo Ha) that it has audiences leading to believe that it would singularly convey his personal experience throughout this ordeal. Seong-hun Kim, the film’s writer and director, can’t help himself but to step outside the introduced boundary to identify the carelessness and apathetic greed of the nation’s elected politicians and intrusive media. Even, Jung-Soo himself introduced to us with a slight apathy behind his outward politeness, a reflection of the country’s overall attitude towards the vulnerable and disabled. I admire the ideas that Seong-hun attempts to tackle, but the frequently shifting satirical tone of the outside world and the melodramatic endurance that fills the air within the tunnel, it becomes a scattered mess that often hides the powerful concepts that sit beneath.",3,13,0,112,"4,456",14-Mar-18,rated-6

Usually, I need to have something recommended to me before I can sit and devote my time to it; this usually cuts down me watching bad movies or movies I just didn't enjoy. Tunnel, however, was just something that came up on my Netflix after watching many k-dramas. The plot sounded similar to a lot of things (I.e. the western ""127 Hours"") and I didn't give it much stock. I decided it would be something I could watch just because I knew I'd put it on my planning to watch list. I decided to kick back and watch it due to a personal goal set by my therapist and wow. Tunnel is a film that starts off relatively slow, and, at first, I'd given up after half an hour because I didn't think there would be much more to it. Prompted to finish it, again, all I can say is just: wow. Tunnel takes you across a journey that is utterly heart wrenching, heart thumping, leaves you on the edge of your seat and left me gasping audibly at different parts of the film. It's hard to remember this film is a work of fiction - the cast is simply amazing. Between their raw emotional acting, the casual gentle humor and the realistic expressions and actions all characters created throughout the film, this was just utterly stunning. For the last forty minutes of the film, I was in tears. My emotions were all over the place, I was stamping my feet with the tense atmosphere, gasping out loud and had to pause a few times to wipe my tears enough to see. The acting alone in this makes this film utterly worth the while, and I was definitely blown away. Maybe it was because I went into this film with low expectations, expecting it to be another rubbish survival movie but this had utterly everything - atmosphere, acting, soundtrack. I would gladly sit and watch this again and I'm not someone who watches something more than once unless completely enamored.

I also do not believe for a second that a phone have battery enough to survive for 23 days while being used regularly. I do not believe a man could survive 36 days recycling his own pee, let alone a pug surviving for that long. I do not believe any policeforce would be stupid enough to drive into a collapsed tunnel and honk the horn a billion times.I do not believe that at no point during those 36 days would no one start pointing fingers at the companies responsible for building that tunnel and talking about massive lawsuits. That's just some of the things in this movie that my suspension of disbelief couldn't reach.  I also didn't understand the score for this film. Most of the time it sounded like a one of those quirky scores for a generic comedy. I never understood the tone they were going for with that. Am I supposed to find this film amusing or am I supposed to take it seriously? There are comedic elements in the film, sure, but the music is used in pretty tense moments where you're supposed to be afraid for the characters.  In the end it seemed like the movie was trying to point the finger at the government for leaving the guy to rot and then later take credits for saving him.  But I was just sitting here like - how the hell can this movie last for 2 fucking hours and not even once is there any focus on the massive lawsuit that would definitely happen in the real world. Instead they'd rather waste time on a side plot where some random worker dies trying to save the main guy and the main guy's wife getting attacked by a dumb bitch who blames her for her son's death. In what world would this happen? I like to think that most people are reasonable, even when grieving. I do not believe for a second that a grieving mother would violently attack the wife of the man her son tried to save. Maybe it's just me. Also, what was the point of the dog? The main guy starts out promising his daughter a puppy to make up for him not being able to make it for her birthday. Then he finds a chick and her pug in the tunnel. The chick dies and he's stuck with the pug for the rest of the movie, but after he gets out we see a shot of the pug in a pet shop.... which makes even less sense because the girl in the car had a mom who was worried about her... wouldn't she want her daughter's pug to remember her by?And why the hell did no one talk about the girl? It's like ""Oh mr. main character is stuck in the tunnel - blah blah blah"" but no one talks about the girl. They don't even try to look for her body. It's like she never even existed. Why didn't her mom show up at the scene to bond with the main guy's wife? Maybe something deeper could've been accomplished with those two characters? Instead we're stuck with a crazy lady who throws eggs at the wife because her son died in a working accident! O_o...

The film initially desires to capture the enduring terror and overall resilience in Jung-Soo Lee (Jung-woo Ha) that it has audiences leading to believe that it would singularly convey his personal experience throughout this ordeal. Seong-hun Kim, the film’s writer and director, can’t help himself but to step outside the introduced boundary to identify the carelessness and apathetic greed of the nation’s elected politicians and intrusive media. Even, Jung-Soo himself introduced to us with a slight apathy behind his outward politeness, a reflection of the country’s overall attitude towards the vulnerable and disabled. I admire the ideas that Seong-hun attempts to tackle, but the frequently shifting satirical tone of the outside world and the melodramatic endurance that fills the air within the tunnel, it becomes a scattered mess that often hides the powerful concepts that sit beneath.",3,13,0,112,"4,456",14-Mar-18,rated-6

For me, and I've said this so many times I ought to copy and paste it to save time, Korean genre films are superb even when they're samey. They're manipulative but feel like they earn the emotional drama, they're stuck firmly in their genre but do it with real class and care, and thoroughly. Tunnel covers so much and throws up dilemmas every 10 minutes that for a film that could have felt claustrophobic and stifling, it knows when to imploy a bit of humour and look at the collapse from another angle.  It's not even really a saturated genre for me, I know there's been a number of these but I've only seen Daylight with Sylvester Stallone, which is good as trashy later night viewing but that's about it.  Korea genre films quality isn't in the writing in terms of the dialogue, or colourful characters, its in the execution of how they construct a thriller, they're experts at it. They take the spectacle of Hollywood and feel good manipulation if need be, and establish this is a genre film meant for entertainment then do it with so much heart, class, sincerity, emotion. They bridge the gap of serious art-house drama and flimsy Hollywood throwaway trash. There are moments in Tunnel which don't make sense, such as reports coming out on the news which are fun to see as they shape the narrative but you have to wonder about the trapped character explaining away all the little incidents he encounters which allows the reporters to seemingly know so much. The film wants you to overlook the way it wants to streamline the experience and I did. In something like Buried, you'd hear ever word spoken, but this wants to cover different angles with speed and clarity, and not get bogged down.  I understand people not taking to Korean thrillers, but I'll never stop singing their praises when they're as enjoyable as this.",5,2,1,227,133,17-Dec-16,rated-9

The only criticism I had was they produce too many thrillers at which they are obviously very very good but now, I am so delighted they are venturing into other genres as well. I am a big admirer of Korean cinema, I want them to grow because they have a shit load of talent. So, I was very excited about Tunnel. Ha Jung woo is one of the best actors in the world right now. Look at his filmography, Chaser, Handmaiden, The client, Nameless Gangster. He's spectacular in every role. He pulls off this film as well. The story is not just a disaster film, it's layered if you put a bit of thought into it. It's really well acted.

One, I thought it was going to be a large group of people trapped in the tunnel and two, I thought it was going to be super emo/brutal like every other SK drama that exists. Really interesting idea to have it, initially anyway, as just one man who is stuck in the tunnel. I like the way the story unfolded in terms of what it was saying about the city and national government too. It never fails to make me laugh, how brutally honest SK filmmakers are at taking the piss out of the failings of their own country - whether it's the incompetence of varying city workers, the corruption of the government or the lengths the government go to try to curry favour with the public.  Both Ha Jung-woo and Bae Doona were great. So was Oh Dal-su. I also like that it was actually quite funny, despite being such a heavy topic. There were a few times where I burst out laughing. Overall, I really quite liked it and found it quite different to many other SK dramas I have seen, which was refreshing.",6,2,0,707,"1,437",12-Jan-19,rated-8

C'est bien plus intelligent que cela. On rentre très rapidement dans le vif du sujet, ce qui est un bon point, pour directement être happé par le film, puis à ma grande surprise on a le droit à une œuvre qui oppose de manière frontale les journalistes, à ce responsable des secours. On a le droit à un point de vue pertinent sur la perversité et l'irrespect des journalistes (la scène des drones est juste énorme), face à un homme de valeur souhaitant secourir cet être humain enseveli sous le tunnel. Le film brasse d'autres thèmes intéressants aussi, avec l'économie de la société de construction du tunnel, les conséquences collatérales de cet effondrement, le rôle du gouvernement... Cependant, qu'est ce que c'est mal rythmé. Je me suis fermement ennuyé au bout de 45min, le tout se répète continuellement, c'est lent, pas toujours captivant. D'ailleurs, je n'ai jamais été sous tension durant le film, excepté le climax, intense par sa musique et son montage rythmé.  Un film explorant la quête toujours plus malsaine des journalistes à travers cet accident peu commun, on regrettera un rythme lent, et un film s'éternisant pour finalement maintenir un propos et une intrigue rapidement redondante.

They used to do this a lot when I was at university, but they weren't the only ones. Another local multiplex fully dedicated itself to the Tartan Asia Extreme 'tours' back then as well, and generally there was a lot more variety in the cinemas round here. I guess Manchester is just a microcosm of the general situation around the country though for those of us wanting to see something other than the blockbusters or those films generating sizable world of mouth. As such, although I'll miss out on Julieta, next week they're knocking out the Hong Kong action thriller Line Walker, which I'm hoping to catch on Monday if my dash from psychotherapy in Hazel Grove to the cinema in Manchester is successful. Otherwise I'll be on here on Monday evening complaining about all the presumed jump scares in Don't Breathe instead, judging by the fucking trailer I saw for it before Morgan the other day. I'm sure you'll be GLUED to your screens awaiting the outcome of this, GLUED I tell you. Of course, the stupid thing about all this above is that it's not like (The) Tunnel is some kind of obscure arthouse offering or anything. It's a pretty universal disaster tale as a tunnel collapses on Jung-woo Ha's car on his way home and he ends up trapped in there for over a month. You only have to look at the fact that it's got three of Korea's biggest and best actors in the lead roles - Ha, Doona Bae and Dal-su Oh - to see that this was very much set up as a crowd-pleasing Korean multiplex pleaser itself. And as such things go, it's extremely enjoyable. There are very few surprises in it and the one big twist is also pretty obvious, and it does have its stupid or unexplained moments that these kinds of films always seem to hope that they will get away with. At the same time, it doesn't dwell that much on the usual cliches, instead just paying them passing attention and mostly focusing on Ha's seemingly hopeless plight and the increasingly desperate efforts of Oh to persuade the authorities that all of the resources being pumped into saving one man are completely justified. Directed Seong-hun Kim, presumably now on Korea's A-list after this and his successful debut A Hard Day, places lots of things on the surface but doesn't get too much into the details of all of them. Stuff like media satire, governmental incompetence and familial complications are all here but they're not dwelt on too much. We all know that the media are bastards in this sort of situation, he doesn't feel the need to wave that in our faces too much. Oh's character is certainly the best thing in this film. Starting out as the manual-reciting leader of the rescue operation (the bit where he yells at an underling because an ideal rescue manual hasn't been translated from English yet is superb), it's great watching him become more and more 'human' as the days wear on and he realises that everything he's been taught and read is almost useless when a mountainside collapses on an incompetently assembled road tunnel. Ha, who was absolutely superb in the little seen terrorist thriller The Terror Live, doesn't start all that strongly here but grows into the film really well - especially when Kim starts filling it with moments of occasionally very silly humour. His reaction to Ha trying to sympathise with his plight by informing him that he also drunk his own urine out of solidarity is golden, as it is when a dog runs off with the only food that he has to eat down there - a birthday cake he was taking home to his daughter. The bit with the army of drones venturing into the tunnel is hilarious as well. I think where (The) Tunnel works best though is regarding how much (or how little) Kim shows us of Ha's surroundings. We see as little as he does, adding to the claustrophobia - and believe me, if you're not good with that sort of thing, you may struggle with this film. I don't know if that's a trigger warning or something but there you go. It's also outstanding in not getting too deep into 'moral conundrums'. Ha, for a short while, has to share what little he has with another survivor, but thankfully doesn't go down the tiresome route of him having to eat her or her dog. Kim fills this film with more than enough to keep you occupied without having to resort to that. It does falter in a couple of places, such as why Oh doesn't descend into a drill-hole earlier to try and hear if Ha is still alive and also regarding the aforementioned obvious twist. It's also a bit non-committal on just how he survives that long on a bit of birthday cake and a few dog biscuits. But this is a well made and really enjoyable survival thriller, extremely well acted and well worth tracking down. Or you can wait for the utterly inevitable Hollywood remake in 2018, your choice.",11,25,12,469,"10,152",8-Sep-16,rated-8

South Korea do such amazing horrors and thrillers but when I find films outside that genre I’m always intrigued to see if I’ll vibe with it. A claustrophobic survival film like this could go either way but I’m glad to say I really enjoyed it!  Tense, exciting, funny, sad and thanks to a fantastic performance from Ha Jung-woo and brilliant support from Bae Doona it is super engaging too!  I love how the humour doesn’t diminish the intensity at all but instead elevates it. Film runtimes in South Korea are generally much longer than we are used to here but it is because they often jam so many more genres into their cinema that it requires the extra time with these characters.

I wish there had been a phone call or something from the temp agency where we learned that she had killed the real temp and assumed her identity but NO ONE in this movie has an identity other than SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, AWESOME WIFE AND MOTHER, SLEAZY BEST FRIEND, GOSSIPY GAY ASSISTANT, CRAZY STALKER LADY, DETERMINED DETECTIVE, INCOMPETENT BABY SITTER, BABY, etc. Part of the fun for me in these sorts of movies (which I will ALWAYS WATCH no matter HOW TERRIBLE they might be) is seeing how the drives and motivations of the main characters fit together or frictionize against each other, resulting in a ginormous conflagration of paranoia, suspicion, threatening electronic communication, last-minute reveals and climatic confrontations. This movie has all of that, but it has no depth to drive the tectonic plates together with enough maniacal force to really get me to clap my hands together in excitement. What it DOES have though, is some great chemistry between Idris Elba and Beyonce (because of course!) and a (SPOILER) pretty serious throwdown between Ali Larter and Beyonce which is definitely one of the reasons I kept watching until the end (like I was going to turn it off? never).",2,43,25,"1,249","5,313",5-Sep-17,rated-5

The film wasn't a disaster and it was quite funny especially during the cat fight near the end.

This is so bad that it gives away not only how it will end but exactly where it will happen within the first five minutes. I think the movie believes it is ‘foreshadowing’.  The score is hilariously bad as well (or at least poorly matched), and adds a lot of unintentional humour (as does how poorly the song they choose to end with matches what just happened). Most of the humour comes from the fact that Ali Larter goes for broke and actually plays a really good crazy person. It’s too bad the movie itself is so lazy or she might have gotten some notice for it. I would almost feel bad about laughing at what is clearly a mental illness and the weird pre MetooToo sexuality in the workplace vibes of this movie if any of these characters resembled actual human beings and weren’t just generic cardboard cut outs.",1,4,0,119,130,4-Apr-20,rated-4

I decided to watch this because I was going to watch a movie with my mum and this one had an interesting premise and, to avoid awkwardness, I checked and sex was minimal. The biggest reason I wanted to watch it was for one person in the cast. Surprisingly it’s not Beyoncé or Idris Elba but Ali Larter. I’m a big Final Destination fan and there was one point where I would have put Ali Larter at my celebrity dinner table.  I had actually heard some negative things about the film but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It is very cliché and the obsessive crush plot has been done many times before but there was something different about this one that made it unique. For starters I actually found it very tense, I mean really very tense. As soon as Ali Larter turned up at Idris Elba’s hotel I just got this massive knot in my stomach that lasted until the very end of the movie. I really don’t know what made it so tense but I applaud it for that. It also had a fantastic ending, which subverted expectations, where Beyoncé is actually the one who has the final showdown with Ali. I absolutely love a good girl fight and this one was great, no matter how predictable. The acting was also pretty good. Both Ali Larter and Beyoncé were standouts, with Ali being better towards the start and Beyoncé towards the end. Idris Elba was kinda of outshined by them two but he was still good anyway. I also loved it when Scout Taylor-Compton appeared, I’m the biggest Halloween fan and I loved her performance in Halloween 2. Although, she really doesn’t have a good track record when it comes to babysitting. It was also really well paced for this type of movie, and especially it’s length. One thing that did kind of piss me off a bit was how no-one believed Idris Elba. It’s one thing not believing that he wasn’t having an affair but it’s another not to believe that he was sexually harassed and raped by Ali Larter’s character. The fact that his wife didn’t even believe him was just horrible. The film actually completely ignores the fact that he was raped and acts like it was a normal thing to have happened. I just feel like a lot of the time men’s stories of sexual harassment and rape really aren’t taken seriously, especially in Hollywood movies (indie films are usually quite different). Although good on the BBFC on putting ‘sexual harassment theme’ in their rating (Netflix has this flagged as ‘discrimination theme though which was weird). The UK rating situation is actually kind of funny because had this not been released when it was, it probably wouldn’t have been rated 12. Had it been released 10 years earlier it would have been 15 (or compulsory cuts) for the headbutt, and had it been released 10 years later it would have been given a 15 for the sexual violence (Idris Elba’s roofied rape).  Overall, Obsessed is a surprisingly good and extremely tense deadly crush movie.  Borderline 3/3.5 out of 5 stars",7,2,0,386,231,19-Jun-20,rated-6

Have I just watched a remake or a blatant rip off? Either way it scores zero for originality.  Originality aside there are some aspects to this film that make it at least watchable and not bad. For a start it has the always under rated Ali Larter and the criminally under used Scout Taylor Compton in it, add in Idris Elba and Beyoncé and you have a decent cast to try and make this plagiarism work. While often predictable it never gets dull and while never exciting it never forces you to look for the remote, it certainly has something to keep you watching and it is likely due to the cast more than anything.  The soundtrack is odd, it has medium sized pop songs from 2009 that do absolutely nothing for me unlike most film soundtracks where I tend to live for a few days in on Spotify. It’s like they could not be bothered to look around for some hidden gems so took a few cheap semi big pop songs but of course Beyoncé gets to sing over the credits.  If you are looking for a film to see Beyoncé challenge Ali Larter for Idris Elba’s attention then this film is most certainly for you. If you are looking for a tense thriller this is not. However if you are just channel hopping one night and this is on, it will be a fairly easy watch and you may just find something in it, especially if you have not watched THE TEMP.",5,9,2,933,"1,025",8-Jan-18,rated-5

I really wanted to dance with Idris Elba with some stupid reindeer antlers on my head smiling gleefully, totally alive in that moment, but it isn't like I have a PROBLEM or something! I don't I really don't! I'm OK! Really!  Ali Larter is CLEARLY INSANE from the first minute we see her! How did she manage to keep her temp job? I wish there had been a phone call or something from the temp agency where we learned that she had killed the real temp and assumed her identity but NO ONE in this movie has an identity other than SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, AWESOME WIFE AND MOTHER, SLEAZY BEST FRIEND, GOSSIPY GAY ASSISTANT, CRAZY STALKER LADY, DETERMINED DETECTIVE, INCOMPETENT BABY SITTER, BABY, etc. Part of the fun for me in these sorts of movies (which I will ALWAYS WATCH no matter HOW TERRIBLE they might be) is seeing how the drives and motivations of the main characters fit together or frictionize against each other, resulting in a ginormous conflagration of paranoia, suspicion, threatening electronic communication, last-minute reveals and climatic confrontations. This movie has all of that, but it has no depth to drive the tectonic plates together with enough maniacal force to really get me to clap my hands together in excitement. What it DOES have though, is some great chemistry between Idris Elba and Beyonce (because of course!) and a (SPOILER) pretty serious throwdown between Ali Larter and Beyonce which is definitely one of the reasons I kept watching until the end (like I was going to turn it off? never).",2,43,25,"1,249","5,313",5-Sep-17,rated-5

The filmmakers spend too much time trying to class up the exploitation genre rather than submitting to their trashier urges, crafting a psychosexual thriller that’s unfortunately too vanilla. The creative high point here is having the villainous home-wrecker live up to that designation during the all out climatic brawl with wronged wife Queen Bey. Their ultimate showdown injects some reality show energy to the proceedings, as choppily put together as it is, but it comes in way too late in the game. All the provocative elements are in place (race/gender/class), yet the bid for respectability keeps the film from fully capitalizing on its taboo pushing potential. This flaw is readily apparent in the script’s decision to have Derek (Idris Elba) never be in danger of succumbing to Lisa’s (Ali Larter) advances, robbing the picture of some dramatic force. Along with the bland visual design, one note characterizations, and cliched plot points; this subpar melodrama tries and fails to be a late 00s’ fusion of Fatal Attraction and Jungle Fever. Though flawed, those films weren’t afraid to embrace their own messiness and make a lasting impression.",2,2,0,143,105,13-Apr-20,rated-3

My goal for this film was to throw out any preconceived notions about Beyonce or her acting etc. I have seen her act before and it was not pretty.  So I really enjoy this genre of film. From Play Misty for me, Fatal Attraction, to The Temp, The Crush etc I have seen a lot of these. Maybe there is some new one I missed, but I feel these days nothing comes along to  give these films a shot in the arm. its all so cliched now.  This suffers from that. But I'm going to tell you a few places it shines. But first Beyonce's acting. It doesn't hurt the film or help the film.  Its there and at times Idris is so good it highlights the fact that Beyonce is not a native actress.  Idris is really a great actor, his acting comes off effortlessly. He really helps lift this cliched film some.  I remember the whole blah blah stealing jobs from African Americans controversy and I'm just like shut up. I get to watch someone other than Denzel, Samuel L, and Fishburn and you people are complaining.  The fight scene is really well done and oddly where both of the actresses shine. Beyonce is much better with the fight ...wait a minute *Choreography,*this is Beyonces world. I stand corrected. Anyway I enjoyed the physical nature of the  fight. Ali Larter who is playing any ole crazy white woman steps it up here as well, some of her crazy faces actually creeped me out here.  All in all if you love the type of film its what you expect, or  a little less, considering the crazy character is never explained, which i personally usually like that particular cliche..  Oh almost forgot! Why do they have like a 4 year old playing  a baby. That kid looks like he should be trading clothes with Idris. Or taking driving lessons.",7,3,0,278,310,17-Apr-19,rated-5

The dramatic scenes between Elba and Beyonce feel awfully forced, and don't really work as I never believed the chemistry between them. A lot of that is probably due to Beyonce's unimpressive performance, and just shows she probably should only act in movies involving singing and dancing (Dreamgirls extc).

A Fatal Attraction style thriller with Beyoncé and Idris Elba? Why not. The film itself is unbelievably predictable and cliched, although still manages to be pretty watchable, particularly in scenes involving Ali Larter, the seductive office temp. I actually found myself rooting for her to win; she was much more interesting than anyone else, and Elba’s marriage to Beyoncé was so plain that I kinda wanted to see it get spiced up a bit. It’s a good thing Beyoncé is excellent at the whole singing and dancing thing, because acting isn’t her strong suit. She’s fine, but a lot of scenes between her and Elba feel like watching amateur hour. It’s never distractingly bad, just enough to make some awkward line deliveries stand out a bit, although there are some other scenes where she’s actually pretty good.

The direction is bad, the music is terrible, Elba has an American accent which cuts down on like 25% of his charm, the mediocre TV-movie script cuts down another 25%. This movie is also just so conceptually bonkers in a post #MeToo world, especially the idea that Beyonce co-starred and co-produced (also, Magic Johnson??) Interesting to watch this right after Beyonce's Homecoming. She never took off as an actor (though we do get her voice as Nala this summer), but Knowles is probably the best in this besides Elba. Granted, she's not given much to do until the third act, but her climactic battle with Becky With The Good Hair is pretty fun to watch, if nothing else.",2,3,0,172,680,19-Apr-19,rated-4

Remember when I said I was going to watch only one horror film from each country and that I would only watch all new stuff? ""That's right, Steve, you did!"" I lied. ""ARRRRRRRRRGH!"" *splat* Well, I've had trouble fitting stuff in and plus I thought it would be cool to end the month revisiting a couple of my all time favourites and seeing if they still stood up. There have been a lot of great reviews flying round for Prince Of Darkness recently, so I couldn't help myself, really. I'm REALLY glad that I made that decision because I think this viewing may have made it my favourite horror film of all time. Well blimey. Prince Of Darkness is an absolutely stunning film. I'm a huge John Carpenter fan and, through his use of his own music and quietly eerie and thoughtful openings, his best films always manage to produce a really unnerving atmosphere right from the beginning. I think this film is the very best example of this and how good he was at it. From the strangely dim sunlight to the priest who appears to have died on his bed to the ants behaving oddly, Carpenter presents us with three disparate elements that give us no clue what is happening or about to happen - we just know immediately that we are not going to like it. It's a pretty simple set-up for what is to come which, actually, is a fair bit more complex than just being about a priest finding some canister of green shit under a church that might well contain Beelzebub himself trying to return to walk the earth. There are so many, once again quite disparate, threads that are knitted together here - religion, creationism, supernatural use of broadcasts and radio waves, the mistranslation of scriptures and astro-physics. It doesn't feel thrown together at all, it's actually beautifully inter-connected in ways that would be beyond most filmmakers. I would say, looking at these elements, that it could be easily Carpenter's most ambitious and unusual film. His films were rarely all that difficult on the brain but I think it would have been interesting to have seen him explore a deeper line of thought in his films after this and the similarly undervalued In The Mouth Of Madness. He clearly has or had an aptitude for it. I suppose it would be easy to pass off a lot of what is said and done in Prince Of Darkness as gibberish and I think there is a certain amount of it that will, Star Trek style, go over your head but not adversely affect your appreciation of the film one iota. There is just too much going on here to let the sillier aspects of the story, and it admittedly has a few, put you off. I would also say that I think this is one of Donald Pleasence's very best performances as a conflicted priest carrying seemingly centuries of Catholic guilt on his shoulders. Most of the acting is competent rather than truly effective, but it hardly seems to matter all that much in a film that is as creepy as this is before it even starts factoring in a 'human' element. The ending, too, is absolutely superb. The final scene gives us another brilliant piece of Carpenter playfulness but the last 15 minutes are terrifically thrilling and unexpectedly nasty. But it's a film that rarely lets up and has a beautiful even pace that would be the match of any of Carpenter's films. Indeed, last time I reviewed this film, I asked whether this should be considered a horror masterpiece and whether it should be as highly regarded as his widely acknowledged classics. On this, my fourth viewing of it, it's an unequivocal yes from me. Quite brilliant.",13,52,14,469,"10,152",28-Oct-12,rated-10

In my worthless opinion, this is his most underrated flick. It stands shoulder to shoulder in quality and in frights with other beloved horror classics. Yet, I could mention this to my close friends and family, and I know they would never have heard of this horror masterpiece.  I love how this film dives head first into the doom and gloom synthesizer riff with a back and forth between scenes and black screen credits. I get sucked into this film world in record time. Carpenter just really know how to get you interested, so quickly. The music continues to creep along in and out constantly through the film. It's never pleasant, letting you know there's always trouble a foot. The score will hit an occasional small climax with a faux-choir, yet it always reverts back to steady, slow, impending doom.  This is one of the creepier films to me. Mainly because Calder and Kelly are just so fucking terrifying. They really played their role with intense insanity. The menacing mirror staring laughs are over the top and just chill inducing.  The ending of this flick is superb and I can't get it out of my head whenever I watch this. When Kelly is pulling out the red hoof/hand out of the mirror and Catherine tackles her into the mirror realm, I'm always blown away. Then after the priest shatters the mirror, we get the saddest shot ever of Catherine reaching from the darkness pool towards the remaining light. Just an A++ movie moment. It's executed perfectly.  5 Alice Cooper bike impalings out of 5",5,31,0,475,549,13-Oct-19,rated-10

I think I probably passed it over so often at the video store because it kinda looks like an Exorcist or The Omen rip-off and I just couldn’t be bothered. I’m glad I finally did see it (sometime within the last 5 years) because not only is it NOT like those movies but damn is it good! A group of scientists gather at a church to study bizarre occurrences related to a recently unearthed cylinder full of an unknown substance. More than anything else, this movie has that classic Carpenter atmosphere. Cheese and rice, y’all. That man knew how to create a great setting. The abandoned church here is just awesome to watch the characters run around in. It really captures that inner city scuzziness with its boarded up windows and alleyways with high fences and I am just here for all of it. The other thing Carpenter excels at is creating some serious GD tension! There’s a scene where a character crawls through a hole in the wall that had me sweatin’, fam! There’s also one where a character jumps out of a window into the alley only to find he needs to get back in the window FAST that just had me shaken AF and I loved it. The practical special effects were quite good. Nothing was terribly overdone and there are some nice moments of gore. The acting ranges from passable to hammy (yes, I promise we love you, Donald Pleasence, now sit down) to godawful (“Susan the one with the glasses” as she’s called at least half a dozen times) but really, what did you expect? I’m sure there are other problems with this movie but if I’m honest, I really can’t see them through all of the seriously delicious atmos. The score (done by Carpenter, as usual) is also impressively notable. Every JC score has a way of sticking with you. Watching two of his movies too close together can result in a blending of both scores inside your head. True story. I should know because I just watched The Fog earlier this week so, like, I have this score with the striking synth heavy beats of that one alternating in my mind as we speak. I’m ok with it. If you’re an 80’s horror fan or a Carpenter groupie, this is a must see. For everyone else, I really don’t see how you could not like this at least a little.

I just couldn't get into this at all. I think it was all the sciencey babble. Nothing makes me zone out of a film faster than sciencey babble. Also, except for the wonderful Donald Pleasence (who has one of my top three Voices in Horror along with Tony Todd and Vincent Price), the cast was made up of ""that person who probably guest starred on at least one episode of every 80s drama,"" you know, that guy. Pleasence was good in his role as the priest, but he wasn't given that much to do. I just found the script and most of the performances really dry.  This is a Carpenter film so there are touches of greatness; the visuals and score are compelling, like really good as always. But it was sooo slow, and dearly missing the charismatic performances in his previous films, you know, Kurt Russell, Adrienne Barbeau, Christine the car? (Sorry, but Christine had more personality than our bland leads here!) This is kiiiinda like The Thing in a church except people are infected by devil juice(?) instead of an alien. And while The Thing has probably the best practical effects I've ever seen, would it be quite the classic it is without the dynamic performances of Russell, Keith David, etc? This isn't a bad film by any means (though it is a terrible poster, woof), I just think it could have been better. No rating, as I don't rate ""not bad, just not for me"" films.

It is prophecy. A warning that all of our worst nightmares are going to happen, but there is a caveat, a bargain, an offering that if you accept Jesus Christ as your personal saviour and devote your life to God you can escape the fate that will await you in the end times. I was always drawn to the Book of Revelations when I was a Christian, because it focused on horror imagery, and I find the death of the world interesting as a narrative tool. John Carpenter feels similarly,  he’s always loved a little “doom and gloom”. Audiences don’t like it typically, because they need to know there will be another day, and John Carpenter has issued a softer amount of wiggle room in some of his apocalyptic visions, but there is no safety net in Prince of Darkness. Accepting Jesus Christ won’t save you from the anti-God. It’s coming. They didn’t save the day. The last image of the movie lingers, because it clearly underlines that we do not understand the full nature of terror that waits for us on the other side of the mirror. We cannot even comprehend it or consider it in the worst reaches of our imagination. It is Eldritch horror. The indescribable.

One you, more often than not, get along with really well.  Prince of Darkness is an odd beast of a horror film and, after this rewatch with a gap of some 15 years preceding it, one I can easily rank among Carpenter's best. This film's scope is a lot bigger than I'm used to from him and it actually has a very clever script, deftly touching upon some quasi philosophical issues without getting heavy handed or making an ass out of itself. In a film that expertly uses the tropes of both the slasher and the zombie genre, Carpenter pits science versus religion, but in the end states that the best weapon against evil/Satan/devils is the human spirit. I love the fact that this is a 'big fight' with the world at stake and that it, for the better part, takes place in only on location. I also love that it doesn't shy away from clever dialogue and takes its time to expose its ideas. Many might find this boring, I just love the religious and science babble. Some of it makes sense, some of it is complete hogwash, but it all adds to the charm of this film. Now, make no mistake, this is still a Carpenter film. And while it perhaps isn't as gory as some of his other films, this does showcase his prime talent. He has the ability to instill his films with oppressive and unnerving atmosphere. From the moment it starts you get the feeling that something is wrong. This feeling only grows worse as the story progresses, leading up to a fantastic climax that more than keeps the promises it made in the first two acts.

You can't turn to God and you can't turn to the empirical methods you thought revealed the Absolute. You don't know anything, you don't even know yourself. The presumption that you know is the tic sucking your spirit dry. But is the act of making this film, and others like it across an extensive and rarely cohesive body of work, not itself proof of why this quest for the truth is necessary? Accepting you know nothing is the first step, then you are free to risk truly understanding. Taking that plunge into the unknown is the most frightening thing of all, more than zombies, insects, aliens, or the anti-God itself. The Father of Satan is nothing compared to the Evil within the individual. Where do we start? Carpenter envisions our new path as found in the distorted reality of the moving image of the future. Neither good nor evil, neither our salvation nor our damnation. Take the leap into the unknown and see what you find.",2,37,6,349,590,13/2/20,0

Watching it today I have certainly warmed up to it but I would not place it up there with top tier Carpenter films, and it's clearly the weakest of Carpenter's ""Apocalypse Trilogy"" in my mind.  Carpenter has always been in his own league when it comes to the look and feel of his movies and this showcases him in fine form. Still there's far too much standing around (literally) and a general lack of momentum to live up to those wonderful visuals.  What struck me on this viewing was a heavy Italian horror influence. Carpenter is an admitted admirer of Argento and more than any of his other movies this really seems to showcase that especially in a middle kill sequence that feels like a full out tribute to a scene from ""Suspira"".  In general the bizarre atmosphere and pacing feels very much like the ground Argento and Lucio Fulci tread in years previous. If anything Carpenter pulls off this style with even stronger visual bombast than they did, but it makes the whole proceedings feel a touch less original and groundbreaking than his landmark horror classics.  I only have a handful of Scream Factory Blu Rays in my collection, but every time I pick one up I am ultra impressed. This movie looks utterly fantastic in hi definition and the extras are plentiful, including a Carpenter commentary which I look forward to listening to.",5,76,4,842,924,15/2/15,0

The second in what he dubs his so-called ""Apocolypse Trilogy"" (following The Thing), I'd hardly say Prince of Darkness is up there with his absolute best, but it's certainly a solid as hell occult thriller that managed to keep me intrigued and occupied throughout. Prince Darkness follows an unnamed priest (played by the late great Donald Pleasence) who discovers an unusual cylinder located within an abandoned church in L.A, which could unleash a potential demonic presence on the earth if unsealed. He brings along a group of students led by Professor Howard Birack to stay inside the church to investigate. As the secrets about it's deadly effects are revealed however, all hell (literally) breaks loose once the group are terrorized and possessed one-by-one by the evil lurking inside. Carpenter had more or less dropped out of the Hollywood scene at this rate (due to Big Trouble's financial failure), so a reduced budget results in an effort of his that feels more restrained. However, I feel that works in it's favour. The fact that most of it is confined to this vacant church gives off more of a claustrophobic and unnerving feel, especially in how Priest, Birack and the students are helplessly surrounded by the possessed hordes lurking outside the church (one of which includes Alice Cooper's cameo as a creepy pale-faced hobo). Now the performances are a mixed bag. Pleasence and Victor Wong make for a good duo of intellectuals, but those playing the students a bit goofy (especially the Asian kid), though maybe that was intentional. As per usual, Carpenter's eye for nice cinemotography and chilling ambience is frequent, as is his ominous and moody scoring work that keeps you on edge throughout. While not as SFX-heavy as The Thing, there are some pretty grotesque and impressive effects here, which include a face  decomposing over time and a reflective mirror filled with water. I will warn that Prince of Darkness is hardly one of Carpenter's most accessible films. Compared to some of his more well-known stuff (like The Thing and Big Trouble), it's a much more slow-paced and plodding affair. If anything however, it knows how to keep keep things going when it comes to the suspense, atmosphere and overall bizarreness. If you dig the guy's work, there's plenty to love here. 8.5/10",7,53,4,780,"1,424",18-Oct-18,rated-8

Carpenter unearths the sublime gothic excess beneath the stultifying beige of urban sprawl, and, in doing so, reveals the secret evil kept in the flesh of men. insects work away at the edges of the world, tiny extant forms of decay amassing into something terrifying and cataclysmic. a man is nothing more than a pile of cockroaches in a suit, and even that collapses as if it were nothing. a virgin birth occurs where there is no virgin and where nothing is born. he plays (in an almost Lynchian fashion) with mirror images and doublings to suggest the rot at the heart of materiality itself, as if what allows us to perceive ourselves as good is only the fact that we can’t see what’s really in the mirror. a man approaches his image and the film ends.",1,108,1,320,"1,012",3-Jul-19,rated-10

I totally forgot how insane some of the kills and effects are in this. The atmosphere is so great and never lets up. Dennis Dun was hilarious too, the scene where he's stuck in that room while the two possessed women are standing just outside so he keeps cracking jokes was a highlight. I think the problem I have with this film is that kinda lacks dynamics. The scenes with over the top kills and effects are always a treat and create so much excitement. However between those moments it always goes back to these really dry dialogue heavy scenes in the church. There's so much exposition and it's all so dense and hard to really believe/follow. It gets to the point where it feels a little too monotonous and you just hold out for another eye-popping death to draw you back in. I gave it a 4 though and I stand by that. I will buy this on blu ray and add it to my collection and I will continue to watch it every couple of years because I believe in Carpenter and he believes in me. He believes in all of us.

On paper I love every single thing about this - one of those films that is perfectly attuned to my sensibilities in terms of what I want out of horror - but I would be lying if I said this was a home run for me. Carpenter's build-up, a mounting atmosphere of foreboding and the promise of an evil beyond science or belief, beyond our realm, is simply flawless...until it isn't. I feel like 3/4s in, we are in the exact same place - narratively, thematically, visually - that we were much earlier on, and the film has burdened itself with so much tension that it needs to start releasing earlier than it does. I'm all for a slow-burn, but everything's going in with so much momentum early on that it struggles to keep its pace at all. I feel like such a loser complaining about things like this but this is so close to being an all-timer for me. The reason I'm so frustrated by my reservations with how Carpenter executes all of this is because the good stuff is some of the best stuff I've ever seen. The premise alone had me instantly, and the way JC lays out the setting and introduces Wong's scientist and Pleasance's priest as two sides of the same coin - the folly and limitation of human understanding and imagination - is superb. The less said about the ending the better, but suffice to say it reaches a primal, cosmic terror that is basically unmatched, with some imagery that chills me to my core even thinking about it now. There's an endless list of things I could rave about this film, but this is a weird scenario where the fact that I was only like 95% on board means that I was only 80% on board, if that makes any sort of sense? It's not any issues I might have with this movie that are the problem, but the fact I had issues at all. A film this good should have no reason not to click with me completely.

A bit of a snooze fest. I agree with my good buddy Rafael when he alludes to the first half being sleep inducing. It's just people walking around, sometimes having plot related conversations, sometimes not. I'm not even sure I understood the reasoning behind all these minds getting together. Donald Pleasance (yes from Halloween) brought my attention swarming back, but every time he left the scene, which was quite often, I just lost it once more. He's never in frame long enough, in any of his roles. Magnificent supporting actor. Toward the end we are treated to some of John Carpenter's signature makeup, as displayed on the skin-crawling cover. Yet at the same time, we also see pitiful effects, like a jet of water clearly to the side of someone's mouth, thinking we're dumb enough to believe it's actually coming from their mouth. Very much a mixed bag. And really, what a great way to describe the whole thing. The acting gets a lot of moments that would make someone giggle but again, DP steals the show.

Unfortunately, a lot of the first hour is filled with discussions of physics and theological philosophy. It’s not even that it’s intellectually threadbare; it’s that it leaves less time for Carpenter to do what Carpenter does best: suspense, action, and gross-but-kiiinda-funny body horror.  Carpenter was one of the talking heads in a couple of Alfred Hitchcock documentaries about camerawork and the use of sound. One of the best segments discussed how  Hitchcock used a variety of methods, both natural and electronic, to make his “Birds” sound harsher and crazier than normal birds. Well, when this film gets to where it needs to be, Carpenter makes worker ants sound like they’re capable of devouring twenty-something scientists in thirty seconds or less.  The zombies lined up across the street from the church was very Assault on Precinct 13, which Carpenter has said was modeled after Rio Bravo.

He's a likely candidate as an artist that will go down in history as being only truly appreciated after his time.  In culture context horror is such a hot-button genre, it's often impossible to separate the hysteria surrounding the art from the actual art.  But outside of the hysteria, looking back with hindsight Carpenter looms large.  Carpenter often trail-blazes new paths in cinema, taking the early heat for being different from the norm as the films that follow in his path gain critical acclaim when it becomes more fashionable and safe to praise them. Carpenter's films are notorious for critical flip-flopping where early reviews punish the director, only to turn on their heels years later and praise the film for the exact same choices they claimed to hate. Carpenter kick-started an unprecedented horror boom that dominated the 1980s and spawned hundreds of millions of fans across the planet and arguably a worldwide revolution of cinema that touched countries like Japan and Korea and France and Italy and many more.  The entire genre became a platform for make-up FX artistry and visual effects with a level of creativity that some would argue was unequalled in any other medium at the time. Make-up FX went from being a niche curiosity to a rock star level art with its creators appearing on late-night talk-shows as superstars. It evolved into a multi-disciplinary form that linked high art with stage magic, puppetry, acting and engineering. Combining these influential theatrical styles into one vast creative force. Carpenter was very much at the front of this advance, pushing for make-up and visual FX art in his films that transcended men in rubber suits and created a new vision of horror.  Abstract expressions of fear became embodied as visual truth with The Thing and They Live and of course...Prince of Darkness. ""Cause precedes effect - fruit rots, water flows downstream. We're born, we age, we die. The reverse never happens. NONE OF THIS IS TRUE! Say goodbye to classical reality, because our logic collapses on the subatomic level into ghosts and shadows.""- Victor Wong as Prof. Howard Birack If you're a kid and you hear that line of dialog and your imagination doesn't pique up just a little? You haven't eaten enough Halloween candy. Get into those goddamn Reese's chocolate peanut butter cups before your parents take them in the night. Prince of Darkness scared me more than any other film as a kid. Up until that point I had seen movies that were gorier, I had seen movies with bigger and more intense jump scares. I had seen The Exorcist, I had seen all the slashers. I had seen movies that made me actually throw-up.  But this one kept me up at night.  This one made me sweat.   The great thing about science is that it can take the mundane existence of humanity and transform it into a vast, seemingly impenetrable cosmic question. Prince of Darkness takes that impenetrable cosmic mystery and creates a terror that transcends the indifference of Lovecraftian horror and reaches out for a truly universal malevolence.  Old Gods become the Anti-God. Prince of Darkness is a story where disturbing messages from the future haunt our idea-space. Where anti-matter gods are waiting just beyond the other side of the mirror. Where a monstrous self-organising demonic entity awakens in a small unassuming church hiding a secret so devastating it threatens to collapse reality itself.  Prince of Darkness is what The Da Vinci Code wants to be when it grows up and gets hair in funny places. Where the Da Vinci Code was blasphemy-lite, and was happy to just fiddle around with questions of Jesus' divinity, Prince of Darkness details a massive conspiracy of the church to hide actual scientific evidence of God.  For fear of us knowing the horrible truth. It's like a lost episode of classic Doctor Who mixed with a Thomas Ligotti short story.  It's so far ahead of its time it feels like it could be a time-travelling idea. It's a frightening blend of the cliche 'Satanic' possession genre of movies and hard science fiction and on top of that surreal and experimental dream logic.

I decided to just binge watch some movies and I had just blind bought the bluray for this one. I knew very little about it, but I knew I loved John Carpenter and had heard this was one of his more underrated movies. I’m watching it and it’s working for me. Although the science and religion talk was a little over my head on this first viewing, the vibe of the movie was pure creepiness and dread. The last scare in the movie made me literally jump off the couch haha. The credits started rolling and I thought “Well damn, that was great!”  Then it happened. A flash of lightning and a huge thunder clap, and the power went out. Now seeing as I just moved into this apartment, I had not yet bought any candles or flashlights and my phone was almost dead. It was probably around 1 a.m. at this point and I was wide awake and I was freaked the fuck out.  All alone. In a totally dark apartment.  I’m not ashamed to admit what I did next. I grabbed my keys, hopped in my car, and drove 10 minutes in a tropical storm to get to my family’s house, lol. Because there wasn’t a chance in hell I was sitting by myself in a pitch black apartment, for who knows how long haha.  So essentially, that whole story was to illustrate how damn good this movie is. How effectively terrifying it is. This is a slow burn that gets under your skin. It’s gotta be the scariest Carpenter movie for me and still stands as one of the creepiest movies I’ve seen. It’s a lot to take in on the first viewing. Subatomic science, priests who formed a secret “Brotherhood of sleep”, the devil in the form of a green, swirling liquid, anti-matter, the Anti-God, and haunting messages from the future, received in dreams, that look like VHS footage. Oh and I almost forgot Alice Cooper and a whole band creepy of homeless people.  I loved it even more this time around and think it’s really something special. Oh and I didn’t leave my house last night after watching it, haha. ALTHOUGH, I did have some weird nightmares last night and even woke up once when I felt like two hands shoved me from behind.  I’m telling ya’ ,this movie has some spooky power to it.",11,42,11,567,632,17-Jul-20,rated-9

If so, did he get teary eyed at the end of the interview after saying how heartwarming and comforting it is [especially in old age] that people still love his films and want interviews with him for releases all of these years later?!?!  I knew it! He's a big softy with a tough exterior, just like me! I seriously love this guy, I know it seems a bit ridiculous to say that because he's a director who I don't know personally, but from his interviews, actions, films, everything, I feel like I get a pretty good sense of what he's like and he's the kind of filmmaker who often uses the same cast & crew over and over again and if he was a terrible person, guess what, I doubt those people would gladly work with him over and over again.  He's also thoughtful, for instance, look at The Thing, at the time of its release it didn't do very well at all [even though it's a great film] and as if to apologize for it not being a success, he calls up Keith David a few years later and offers him a role in They Live, the same goes for Big Trouble in Little China, another film that didn't do nearly as well as they'd hoped and he recasts Dennis Dun and Victor Wong to have major roles in Prince of Darkness, was he giving them a second chance or did he just like them? Probably a little bit of both.   Watching the opening credits of a John Carpenter film is always a treat as well, he's a humble man, often using a pseudonym for the writing credit that belongs to him.  There are definitely directors *cough*Argento*cough* who make sure you know they have written, produced and directed a film (because their name will appear three separate times and then one more time with a combined credit and then maybe a name over the title too, just in case you missed it). John Carpenter is so rad and I can't wait to see him perform in August, I'll try not to cry but I can't make any promises.  As for Prince of Darkness, I love it.  I love the way the guy's body collapses into a pile of beetles, the effects used to put hands through mirrors, the green fluid, the dismal ending, the nightmarish transmissions from 1 9 9 9, and that every time I watch it I have to force myself to pay attention to details because I pick up something new on each watch.",5,364,18,439,"15,363",15-Jul-16,rated-8

The long and patient wait for a Blu-Ray release was worth it as not only is The Scream Factory’s release excellent but the film is as wonderfully creepy as it ever has been. Prince of Darkness is Carpenter’s unjustly forgotten minor-classic. Produced in-between the delightfully batty duo of Big Trouble in Little China and They Live, this moody horror film is closer in style to his earlier attention-grabbing genre hits. Only now beginning to receive the attention it deserves, this eerie throwback (a strange amalgamation of Carpenter’s own cinematic obsessions) is a wonderful blend of horror and science-fiction as religion and science come together to repel the forces of evil. Following the death of a colleague, Donald Pleasance’s priest discovers a diary about a secret sect of the church who protect a mysterious canister hidden in a derelict Los Angeles church. Employing a team of physicists and other scientists they attempt to unravel the mystery of this ominous cylinder but get more than they bargained for when they are confronted with the ultimate evil. Although showing its age due to the dubious hairstyles of the period, Prince of Darkness remains pleasingly fresh thanks to its insidious ambience and meticulous pacing. Few directors, before or since, are as skilled as Carpenter at creating an ominous atmosphere with such efficiency. Within the opening bars of Carpenter and Alan Howarth’s synth score he has instantly set the mood for the film as it slowly builds towards its shocking and graphic climax. Written by Carpenter under the pseudonym, Martin Quatermass, it is a film that is indebted to the eerie sci-fi of writer, Nigel Kneale. Like Kneale’s best work (from The Quatermass and the Pit to The Stone Tape), Carpenter reveals supernatural horror through the rigors of science. Although most of the scientific explanations in the film are deliberately nonsensical it helps create an interesting friction between the rational and nonrational. Like a master puppeteer, Carpenter controls the audience from the opening frame right through the protracted credit sequences and to the eerie closing premonition. By modern standards the pacing would be considered slow but Carpenter judges the deliberate pacing to perfection. He slowly builds the tension by revealing hints of the horror that is to come as insects infest the church, vagrants ominously gather outside and portentous ancient scripture is decoded to reveal the evil lurking inside the mystery box. With an apocalyptic atmosphere pervading every scene, Carpenter refuses to fall back on jump scares, instead favouring creeping dread to elicit chills. In an age where horror is little more than an amusement park ride of carefully orchestrated loud noises it is so refreshing to go back to a time when the genre relied on mood rather than cheap shocks. Yet the film is not simply one long tease as it gradually builds to a crescendo of sustained and vivid horror. As the scientists discover the truth about the canister they become trapped inside the church, not only by the homeless siege outside but from the evil within as the group are slowly possessed one-by-one (interestingly, the first to become possessed by satan’s goo is a Linda Blair lookalike). The film’s climax, with its grotesque body horror and thrilling last stand showdown, delivers the finale the methodical build-up deserved. Even though some of the practical effects have dated the final half an hour is brilliant, not only sustaining the tension but also creating some of Carpenter’s greatest individual moments (the grainy subconscious message, heroic self-sacrifice and Pleasance with an axe).  Prince of Darkness might not be perfect - I’m not blind to the fact the script is clunky, the performances variable and that the film occasionally resembles a greatest hits of Carpenter’s earlier movies - but none of the faults impact on the film’s obvious qualities. This is a moody, forbidding and brilliantly crafted horror film that deserves as much love and attention as Carpenter’s most celebrated work.",9,252,47,240,"14,625",16-Oct-13,rated-9

The transfer is great, and although it's not an overly flashy film (a lot of it taking place in square, brick rooms) it's terrifically staged and exciting. This time around I watched it with the DVD commentary track featuring John Carpenter and Peter Jason. Some thoughts: + Carpenter, as usual, is very soft-spoken, genial, and informative. Jason refers to his sets as a family, and talks about how collaborative the experiences are. In fact, the very first few minutes of the commentary track establish this, with an interesting story about Jason pitching the possessed folk in the story as the 'seven deadly sins' and Carpenter thinking it was interesting, but giving up on it for budgetary/practical reasons. They don't have Carpenter/Russell level chemistry, but there's clearly an easy fondness between the two, and a shared love of stories. (They don't digress as much as Carpenter and Russell do, either, although they spend about five minutes chatting over GHOSTS OF MARS, with Jason ribbing Carpenter a bit about it) +They talk a lot about the other cast members. Victor Wong and Donald Pleasance in particular get shout-outs. Some genuinely touching bits for both men and experiences they went through when younger, and a lot of laughs over a scene where other characters are barricading a door and Wong is doing as little as possible in the room, and another scene where Wong forgets(?)/gives up on a scene partway through and just walks off camera, leaving Peter Jason's character scrambling. +Despite being prominently featured in publicity for this film, Alice Cooper really is a minor character. The pigeon cross and the stabby-bicycle are really quite memorable though, more so than the other hobo with screen time, 'Merlin'. There's a shot that bugged me (when she runs up and stabs one skeptical dude to death out in the parking lot) because it looks fake and kind of comic-booky, could probably be cut out of the scene without losing anything, and yet, hearing Carpenter talk about how tricky it was to get that shot of the knife rushing really makes me feel bad about that. Sorry Mr. Carpenter! (Also, the stabbing was apparently inspired by CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF, which is a good film if you haven't seen it) +One reason I really like the film is because of the God/Anti-God cosmology it pushes, which is so different from what a lot of American Horror was doing in the 80s. It's kind of bemusing then that Carpenter kind of dismisses a lot of the plotting of the film as nonsense near the beginning. I'm not sure whether he feels it would seem silly if he tried to explain it or just has changed his views on the script as he's gotten older or doesn't want to try and clear things up too much for Jason (who keeps calling the Anti-God Satan, f'rinstance, directly after Carpenter says that it's distinctly NOT Satan) so it's easier just to say 'yeah, it's all goofy window-dressing' and talk about logistics more) +That said, Jason, who really does seem interested by the story and the background more than Carpenter, makes an excellent point--after the computer gets possessed/starts spitting out threats, all the other characters kind of ignore it and focus more on the fact that some of them are missing--all the while the computer KEEPS ranting in the background. Seems like a missed opportunity to try and communicate with the Evil One. +They also pinpoint the exact moment a certain character gets impregnated by the Evil One, which is kind of low-key and earlier in the film than I had thought. Carpenter (Again speaking of influence) got the symbol 'brand' idea off of the cover of a Blue Oyster Cult album! +The mirror effects of the climax were difficult to get just right--the final effect ended up using mercury(!) instead of glass, and then cut to an underwater swimming pool where they were filming in the dark. From the sounds of it, poor Lisa Blount, the actress who had to dive headfirst into the mirror and thus jump into a swimming pool in the dark, was kind of terrified. +The 'dream' effect was also really interesting, and achieved through filming footage while it was being broadcast on TV.  +All those scenes of worms and bugs led to repeated discussion of a 'bug wrangler' a job that Peter Jason finds fascinating. For myself, I actually WASN'T too bugged (har har) by the 'I have a message for you' scene, which gives me a bit of hope that I may be over my irrational itchiness when scenes of creepy-crawlies feature in films. Maybe I can go back and give SLUGS a fair shake! (No, I probably won't) In closing, this continues to be a great Horror film, John Carpenter is great, and Peter Jason seems like he would be a great barbecue guest, least of all for his John Wayne impression.",11,27,2,"1,301","1,342",9-Oct-16,rated-8

This unfortunately extends even further—it wouldn't be a properly Lovecraftian tale without some unpleasantly problematic undertow; the way this views homeless people as ""subhuman"" is cheap and stupid. Otherwise the film's chief weakness is the way Carpenter grafts this classically Lovecraftian horror over routine slasher shit—the cast of forty-year old college students are all boring, horny idiots who spend most of the movie hiding in locked rooms, which chafes against the extremely cool cosmic horror stuff about sentient evil prebiotic slime from another universe, Alien Jesus, the Anti-God, warnings broadcast from the future beamed into sleeping brains in the past, etc. The score is Carpenter's magnum opus; it's his most complex music, building and building and propelling the film ever forward, actually developing themes and motifs in a way his other work generally doesn't.",2,25,0,162,"1,568",30-Oct-20,rated-8

Much of the story is inexplicable and betrays any sense of logic as Carpenter fully embraces the depiction of evil he toyed with in Halloween and Christine. Evil has always been an indecipherable, unstoppable force in Carpenter's work, but here he goes full Argento and really embraces the unfathomable, delivering a genuinely unsettling ride. It's all a nightmare, or perhaps a transmission. There are images here that somehow feel beyond imagination, and at risk of delving into a lot of hyperbole, I'll just say I'm not fully convinced this movie was actually filmed.

Selten wurde es aber so atmosphärisch umgesetzt wie von Carpenter. Ein Team von Wissenschaftlern versammelt sich in einer alten Kirche um einen Priester (Donald Pleasence), um ein dort gefundenes Gefäß zu untersuchen. Schon bald sind sie sich sicher, dass bei Öffnung der Leibhaftige auf die Erde kommen und alles vernichten wird. Bereits zu Beginn baut Prince of Darkness dank seinen kargen Bildern und eindringlichem Synthie-Score eine fesselnde Atmosphäre auf. Obwohl noch gar nichts passiert ist, macht sich Unbehagen breit. Leider verschleppt sich diese Atmosphäre dann im Mittelteil etwas. Dort liegt viel Fokus auf den Charakteren, was generell zu begrüßen ist, wären diese nicht recht eindimensional und stereotypisch. So nach und nach setzt sich dann aber der Horror durch und der Film kommt wieder auf die richtige Spur. Carpenter zaubert dann auch so einige eklige, praktische Effekte aus dem Ärmel und die Anzahl der von der Dunkelheit konsumierten Wissenschaftlern steigt. Prince of Darkness ist ein unheimlicher, atmosphärisch dichter Horrorfilm, der ein bekanntes Horrormotiv ansprechend aufbereitet. Leider weiß er nicht immer richtig etwas mit seiner Laufzeit anzufangen, lässt seine Figuren wirr durch die alte Kirche rennen und verschleppt sich so im Mittelteil. Dafür ist das Finale dann wieder um so stärker und kommt mit einem unangenehm dystopischen Abschluss daher.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ The reawakening of the old evil is a popular scenario in horror movies. Rarely has it been so atmospherically realized as by Carpenter. A team of scientists gathers in an old church around a priest (Donald Pleasence) to examine a vessel found there. Soon they are sure that when the vessel is opened, the person in the flesh will come to earth and destroy everything. Already at the beginning Prince of Darkness creates a captivating atmosphere thanks to his sparse pictures and penetrating synthie score. Although nothing has happened yet, discomfort is spreading. Unfortunately, this atmosphere gets a little bit worse in the middle part. There is a lot of focus on the characters, which is generally to be welcomed, if they wouldn't be quite one-dimensional and stereotypical. Gradually, however, the horror becomes more and more apparent and the movie gets on the right track again. Carpenter conjures some disgusting, practical effects out of his sleeve and the number of scientists consumed by the darkness increases. Prince of Darkness is an uncanny, atmospherically dense horror movie, that appealingly presents a well-known horror motif. Unfortunately, he doesn't always really know what to do with his running time, lets his characters run through the old church and gets carried away in the middle part. Instead, the finale is all the stronger and comes along with an unpleasantly dystopic ending.",10,26,1,130,"3,852",6-Jun-19,rated-7
